Abstract: Brucellosis infects humans and animals worldwide but is particularly prevalent in Asia. In many Asian countries, molecular diagnostic tools for accurate molecular diagnostics and molecular epidemiology are lacking. Nonetheless, some countries have conducted in-depth molecular epidemiological studies. The objective of this study was to reveal the genetic relationships, geographic origins, and distributions of Brucella strains across Asia for two primary species, B. abortus and B. melitensis. For this, we systematically searched genotyping data from published studies on the molecular epidemiology of Brucella species for both humans and livestock in Asia. We used data from multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and whole genome sequencing analysis of Brucella strains. We also analyzed the MLVA genotypes of 129 B. abortus isolates and 242 B. melitensis isolates with known origins in Asia from an online MLVA database using MLVA-11 data in minimum spanning trees and MLVA-16 data in neighbor-joining trees. We found that the B. melitensis East Mediterranean lineage is predominant across the continent, with only a small number of samples from the Africa and Americas lineages, and none from the West Mediterranean lineage. The "abortus C" genotype was the most common group of B. abortus in Asia, with limited genetic variation for this species. Several studies also reported that Near Eastern countries frequently encounter human brucellosis cases of B. abortus from genotypes 42 and 43. Our study highlights the inconsistent collection of genetic data for Brucella species across Asia and a need for more extensive sampling in most countries. Finally, a consistent nomenclature is necessary to define various groupings of strains within a lineage (i.e., clade) so uniform terminology should denote particular genetic groups that are understood by all researchers.

Abstract: A zoonotic disease called brucellosis can cause flu-like symptoms and heart inflammation. The bacteria responsible for this disease can also enter the brain, causing a condition called neurobrucellosis that can result in long-term neurological problems. In this study, researchers aimed to determine the changes in the hippocampal cells of rats infected with Brucella. For the study, 24 adult male albino rats were inoculated with 1 × 106 CFU Brucella abortus 544. The rats were then deeply anesthetized, and their hippocampus samples were taken for stereological, histological, and molecular studies. The results showed that the infected rats had increased microgliosis and astrogliosis. Furthermore, a high level of caspase-3 in their hippocampal tissue indicated their susceptibility to apoptosis. Additionally, there was a decrease in expression of Ki67, which further supported this. Sholl's analysis confirmed a significant failure in glial morphology. The study demonstrated that the pathogen has the ability to destroy the hippocampus and potentially affect its normal physiology. However, more research is needed to clarify various aspects of neurobrucellosis.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a chronic and debilitating disease in humans, causing great economic losses in the livestock industry. Making an effective vaccine is one of the most important concerns for this disease. The new mRNA vaccine technology due to its accuracy and high efficiency has given promising results in various diseases. The objective of this research was to create a novel mRNA vaccine with multiple epitopes targeting Brucella melitensis. Seventeen antigenic proteins and their appropriate epitopes were selected with immunoinformatic tools and surveyed in terms of toxicity, allergenicity, and homology. Then, their presentation and identification by MHC cells and other immune cells were checked with valid tools such as molecular docking, and a multi-epitope protein was modeled, and after optimization, mRNA was analyzed in terms of structure and stability. Ultimately, the immune system's reaction to this novel vaccine was evaluated and the results disclosed that the designed mRNA construct can be an effective and promising vaccine that requires laboratory and clinical trials.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella, which is difficult to be eliminated by conventional drugs. Therefore, a novel multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) was designed to prevent human Brucella infection. Based on the method of "reverse vaccinology", cytotoxic T lymphocytes epitopes (CTLEs), helper T lymphocytes epitopes (HTLEs), linear B-cell epitopes (LBEs) and conformational B-cell epitopes (CBEs) of four Brucella proteins (VirB9, VirB10, Omp 19 and Omp 25) were obtained. In order to keep the correct protein folding, the multiple epitopes was constructed by connecting epitopes through linkers. In view of the significant connection between human leukocyte antigen CTLA-4 and B7 molecules found on antigen presenting cells (APCs), a new vaccine (V_C4MEV) for preventing brucellosis was created by combining CTLA-4 immunoglobulin variable region (IgV_CTLA-4) with MEV protein. Immunoinformatics analysis showed that V_C4MEV had a good secondary and tertiary structure. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MD) revealed a robust binding affinity between IgV_ CTLA-4 and the B7 molecule. Notably, the vaccine V_C4MEV was demonstrated favorable immunogenicity and antigenicity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. V_C4MEV had the potential to activate defensive cells and immune responses, offering a hopeful approach for developing vaccines against Brucella in the upcoming years.

DOI: 10.1007/s00284-024-03847-x
Abstract: The Pantanal region, the largest floodplain in the world, has a huge biodiversity and is an important livestock center. Bovine brucellosis has been reported in the region over the last three decades, posing implications for cattle industry as well as for the maintenance of biodiversity. We aimed to investigate the presence of B. abortus S19 vaccine strain DNA in unvaccinated domestic and wild ungulates from the Brazilian Pantanal. Fifty-two heifers, 63 ovine, 24 domestic pigs, 28 feral pigs, and three Pampas deer were sampled. Brucella spp. was detected through bcsp31 PCR of blood samples in 45.3% (77/170) of the sampled animals, of which 36.4% (28/77) showed positivity in ery PCR corresponding to B. abortus S19 strain. Feral pigs presented the highest occurrence of positive samples in bcsp31 PCR (75%), followed by ovine (47.6%), domestic pigs (41.7%), and unvaccinated heifers (30.8%). We did not observe positivity in Pampas deer. Our results strongly suggest that vaccination against bovine brucellosis may promote spill-over of B. abortus S19 strain in the Pantanal region. Moreover, our data indicate that wild strains of Brucella circulates in the Pantanal Biome.

Abstract: Live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) whose virulence would be controlled at the tissue level could be a crucial tool to effectively fight intracellular bacterial pathogens, because they would optimize the induction of protective immune memory while avoiding the long-term persistence of vaccine strains in the host. Rational development of these new LAVs implies developing an exhaustive map of the bacterial virulence genes according to the host organs implicated. We report here the use of transposon sequencing to compare the bacterial genes involved in the multiplication of Brucella melitensis, a major causative agent of brucellosis, in the lungs and spleens of C57BL/6 infected mice. We found 257 and 135 genes predicted to be essential for B. melitensis multiplication in the spleen and lung, respectively, with 87 genes common to both organs. We selected genes whose deletion is predicted to produce moderate or severe attenuation in the spleen, the main known reservoir of Brucella, and compared deletion mutants for these genes for their ability to protect mice against challenge with a virulent strain of B. melitensis. The protective efficacy of a deletion mutant for the plsC gene, implicated in phospholipid biosynthesis, is similar to that of the reference Rev.1 vaccine but with a shorter persistence in the spleen. Our results demonstrate that B. melitensis faces different selective pressures depending on the organ and underscore the effectiveness of functional genome mapping for the design of new safer LAV candidates.

Abstract: Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella, presents a significant threat to both animal and human health. In animals, the disease can lead to infertility, miscarriage, and high fever, while in humans, symptoms may include recurrent fever, fatigue, sweating, hepatosplenomegaly, and joint and muscle pain following infection. Treatment often involves long-term antibiotic therapy, placing a substantial psychological and financial burden on patients. While vaccination is crucial for prevention, current animal vaccines have drawbacks such as residual virulence, and a safe and effective human vaccine is lacking. Hence, the development of a vaccine for brucellosis is imperative. In this study, we utilized bioinformatics methods to design a multi-epitope vaccine targeting Brucella. Targeting Heme transporter BhuA and polysaccharide export protein, we identified antigenic epitopes, including six cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) dominant epitopes, six helper T lymphocyte (HTL) dominant epitopes, one conformation B cell dominant epitope, and three linear B cell dominant epitopes. By linking these epitopes with appropriate linkers and incorporating a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist (human beta-defensin-2) and an auxiliary peptide (Pan HLA-DR epitopes), we constructed the multi-epitope vaccine (MEV). The MEV demonstrated high antigenicity, non-toxicity, non-allergenicity, non-human homology, stability, and solubility. Molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the interaction and stability of the MEV with receptors (MHCI, MHCII, TLR4). Codon optimization and in silico cloning validated the translation efficiency and successful expression of MEV in Escherichia coli. Immunological simulations further demonstrated the efficacy of MEV in inducing robust immune responses. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the engineered MEVs have the potential to stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, offering valuable insights for the future development of safe and efficient Brucella vaccines.

DOI: 10.7774/cevr.2024.13.3.232
Abstract: Purpose: Brucellosis, a zoonotic infectious disease, is a worldwide health issue affecting animals and humans. No effective human vaccine and the complications caused by the use of animal vaccines are among the factors that have prevented the eradication of the disease worldwide. However, bio-engineering technologies have paved the way for designing new targeted and highly efficacious vaccines. In this regard, the study aimed to evaluate immunity induced by mannosylated niosome containing Brucella recombinant trigger factor/Bp26/Omp31 (rTBO) chimeric protein in a mouse model. Materials and methods: rTBO as chimeric antigen (Ag) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and, after purification, loaded on niosome and mannosylated niosome. The characteristics of the nanoparticles were assessed. The mice were immunized using rTBO, niosome, and mannosylated niosome-rTBO in intranasal and intraperitoneal routes. Serum antibodies (immunoglobulin [Ig]A, IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) and splenocyte cytokines (interferon-gamma, interleukin [IL]-4, and IL-12) were evaluated in immunized mice. Finally, immunized mice were challenged by B. melitensis and B. abortus. A high antibody level was produced by niosomal antigen (Nio-Ag) and mannosylated noisomal antigen (Nio-Man-Ag) compared to the control after 10, 24, and 38 days of immunization. The IgG2a/IgG1 titer ratio for Nio-Man-Ag was 1.2 and 1.1 in intraperitoneal and intranasal methods and lower than one in free Ag and Nio-Ag. Cytokine production was significantly higher in the immunized animal with Ag-loaded nanoparticles than in the negative control group (p<0.05). Moreover, cytokine and antibody levels were significantly higher in the injection than in the inhalation method (p<0.05). Results: The combination of mannosylated noisome and rTBO chimeric proteins stimulate the cellular and humoral immune response and produce cytokines, playing a role in developing the protective acquired immune response in the Brucella infectious model. Also, the intraperitoneal route resulted in a successful enhancement of cytokines production more than intranasal administration. Conclusion: Designing an effective vaccine candidate against Brucella that selectively induces cellular and humoral immune response can be done by selecting a suitable nanoniosome formulation as an immunoadjuvant and recombinant protein as an immune response-stimulating Ag.

DOI: 10.1016/j.anaerobe.2024.102899
Abstract: Objective: Flagellin protein, an integral component of flagella, provides motility to several bacterial species and also acts as a candidate antigen in diagnostics and subunit vaccines. The bulk production of flagellin with retention of all conformational epitopes using recombinant protein technology is of paramount importance in the development of pathogen-specific immuno-assays and vaccines. We describe the production of highly soluble and immuno-reactive rFliA(C) protein of Clostridium chauvoei, a causative agent of blackleg or black quarter (BQ) affecting cattle and small ruminants worldwide. The bacterium is known to possess peritrichous flagella that provide motility and also act as a virulence factor with high protective antigenicity. Methods: Upon sequence and structural analysis, a partial fliA(C) gene from Clostridium chauvoei was cloned and the recombinant mature protein with N- and C- terminal truncation was over-expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein (∼25 kDa) in Escherichia coli. Subsequently, rFliA(C) protein was purified by single-step affinity chromatography and characterized for its immuno-reactivity in laboratory animals, Western blot, and indirect-ELISA format. Results: rFliA(C) was highly soluble and was purified in high quantity and quality. rFliA(C) elicited antigen-specific conformational polyclonal antibodies in rabbit and guinea pig models, as well as anti-Clostridium chauvoei-specific antibodies being specifically detected in BQ-vaccinated and convalescent sera of bovines in Western blot and in indirect-ELISA format. Further, no cross reactivity was noted with antibodies against major bovine diseases (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease, IBR, LSDV, hemorrhagic septicaemia, brucellosis, and leptospirosis). Conclusion: The study indicated the production of conformational recombinant flagellin-rFliA(C)-antigen and its potential utility in development of diagnostics for detection of Clostridium chauvoei-specific antibodies in BQ-recovered and/or vaccinated animals.

Abstract: Background: Brucellosis vaccines are designed to induce cellular immunity. An effective brucellosis vaccine could induce both cellular and humoral immunity. Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) is an important method for determining vaccine humoral immunity. This study is the first to observe humoral immunity in brucellosis by SBA. Methods: Extracted Brucella abortus (B. abortus) Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) were injected into rabbits. Group 1 was injected with 25 μg of LPS, Group 2 was injected with 50 μg of OMPs, and Group 3 was injected with 1 ml of combined vaccine, 3 times every 2 weeks. The groups were challenged with B. abortus 544 in the second injection. Sera were separated 2 weeks after the last injection. SBA was performed, and each well was streak-cultured into a plate of Brucella agar. A colony count was done for each plate. Results: Results have shown, the third injection of the combined vaccine had the highest titer of
1/64, and the efficacy of the vaccine was 87.71%. Conclusion: As a conclusion, the results of this study showed that LPS and OMP's from B. abortus can provide acceptable immunity.

Title: Characterization of the adaptive cellular and humoral immune responses to persistent colonization of Brucella abortus strain RB51 in a Jersey cow
Authors: Boggiatto Paola M, Sterle Haley, Falkenberg Shollie, Sarlo-Davila Kaitlyn, Putz Ellie J, Olsen Steven C
DOI: 10.3389/fvets.2024.1367498
Abstract: Brucella abortus strain RB51 is the commercial cattle vaccine used in the United States (US) and many parts of the world against bovine brucellosis. RB51 was licensed for use in 1996, and it has been shown to be safe and efficacious in cattle, eliciting humoral and cellular responses in calves and adult animals. In 2017, an epidemiological trace-back investigation performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified human cases of brucellosis caused by infection with RB51. These infections resulted from the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, which were traced back to otherwise healthy animals that were shedding RB51 in their milk. At the current time, six adult Jersey cows have been identified in the U.S. that are shedding RB51 in milk. One of the RB51 shedding cattle was obtained and housed at the National Animal Disease Center (NADC) for further study. Improved understanding of host cellular and humoral immune responses to RB51 in persistently colonized cattle may be achieved by the characterization of responses in shedding animals. We hypothesized, based on the lack of RB51 clearance, that the RB51 shedder animal has a diminished adaptive cellular immune response to RB51. Our data demonstrate that in the presence of persistent RB51 infection, there is a lack of peripheral anti-RB51 CD4+ T cell responses and a concurrently high anti-RB51 IgG humoral response. By understanding the mechanisms that result in RB51 persistence, the development of improved interventions or vaccinations for brucellosis may be facilitated, which would provide public health benefits, including reducing the risks associated with the consumption of non-pasteurized milk products.

Abstract: Introduction: Human brucellosis, caused by the bacteria Brucella, is a significant infectious disease globally, also known as Mediterranean fever or Malta fever. Methods: This meta-analysis and systematic review focuses on the prevalence rate, risk factors, and diagnostic methods of human brucellosis in Middle Eastern countries, where the disease remains a significant public health issue. The analysis included 92 studies conducted between 1993 and 2024, following specified inclusion and exclusion criteria among symptomatic patients across these countries. The prevalence rate was calculated by dividing positive samples by total samples. The I2 index and Chi-squared test assessed study heterogeneity. Significant heterogeneity occurred when I2 exceeded 50 %. Results: The highest prevalence rate was observed in Oman, Lebanon, and Kuwait countries, emphasizing a notable burden of Brucella infection in these regions. Risk factors associated with human brucellosis were identified, with unpasteurized dairy consumption and close animal contact being predominant. Various professions such as farmers, dairy factory workers, and agriculture workers showed higher prevalence rate. Gender analysis indicated a prevalence rate of 18.02 % (95 % CI: 11.55-25.51 %) in males and 13.61 % (95 % CI: 10.8-16.68 %) in females, with no significant difference in hospitalization rates. The prevalence rate of Brucella spp. was varied across detection methods, with immunocapture agglutination assay (Brucellacapt) showing the highest estimated prevalence rate of (44.04 %, 95 % CI: 27.71-61.04), followed by PCR (39.84 %, 95 % CI: 20.14-61.39) and culture (29.22 %, 95 % CI: 17.89-42.03). Among Brucella species, Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) and Brucella abortus (B. abortus) were the highest prevalence rate. Although statistically insignificant, the meta-analysis also revealed an upward trend in prevalence rate from 1993 to 2024, (P value = 0.277). Discussion: This comprehensive review emphasizes the need for tailored strategies to control brucellosis in the Middle East, highlighting the importance of timely diagnosis, public awareness, and effective treatment protocols. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals working to mitigate the impact of this disease in the region.

Abstract: (1) Background: One method of eradicating brucellosis is to cull cattle that test positive for antibodies 12 months after being vaccinated with the 19-strain vaccine. Variations in immunization regimens and feeding practices may contribute to differences in the rate of persistent antibodies. We conducted this study to investigate the real positive rate of Brucella antibody in field strains of Brucella spp. after immunization over 12 months in dairy cows. This research aims to provide data to support the development of strategies for preventing, controlling, and eradicating brucellosis. (2) Method: We employed the baseline sampling method to collect samples from cows immunized with the A19 vaccine for over 12 months in Lingwu City from 2021 to 2023. Serological detection was conducted using the RBPT method. An established PCR method that could distinguish between 19 and non-19 strains of Brucella was utilized to investigate the field strains of Brucella on 10 dairy farms based on six samples mixed into one using the Mathematical Expectation strategy. (3) Results: We analyzed the rates of individual seropositivity and herd seropositive rates in dairy cattle in Lingwu City from 2021 to 2023 and revealed that antibodies induced by the Brucella abortus strain A19 vaccine persist in dairy herds for more than 12 months. We established a PCR method for identifying both Brucella A19 and non-A19 strains, resulting in the detection of 10 field strains of Brucella abortus from 1537 dairy cows. By employing a Mathematical Expectation strategy, we completed testing of 1537 samples after conducting only 306 tests, thereby reducing the workload by 80.1%. (4) Conclusions: There was a certain proportion of cows with a persistent antibody titer, but there was no evidence that all of these cattle were naturally infected with Brucella. The established PCR method for distinguishing between Brucella abortus strain 19 and non-19 strains can be specifically utilized for detecting natural Brucella infection in immunized cattle. We propose that relying solely on the detection of antibodies in cattle immunized with the A19 vaccine more than 12 months previously should not be solely relied upon as a diagnostic basis for brucellosis, and it is essential to complement this approach with PCR analysis to specifically identify field Brucella spp. Brucella abortus was the predominant strain identified in the field during this study. Detection based on the Mathematical Expectation strategy can significantly enhance detection efficiency.

Abstract: Brucellosis is an economically important zoonotic disease affecting humans, livestock, and wildlife health globally and especially in Africa. Brucella abortus and B. melitensis have been isolated from human, livestock (cattle and goat), and wildlife (sable) in South Africa (SA) but with little knowledge of the population genomic structure of this pathogen in SA. As whole genome sequencing can assist to differentiate and trace the origin of outbreaks of Brucella spp. strains, the whole genomes of retrospective isolates (n = 19) from previous studies were sequenced. Sequences were analysed using average nucleotide identity (ANI), pangenomics, and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (wgSNP) to trace the geographical origin of cases of brucellosis circulating in human, cattle, goats, and sable from different provinces in SA. Pangenomics analysis of B. melitensis (n = 69) and B. abortus (n = 56) was conducted with 19 strains that included B. abortus from cattle (n = 3) and B. melitensis from a human (n = 1), cattle (n = 1), goat (n = 1), Rev1 vaccine strain (n = 1), and sable (n = 12). Pangenomics analysis of B. melitensis genomes, highlighted shared genes, that include 10 hypothetical proteins and genes that encodes for acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (acs), and acylamidase (aam) amongst the sable genomes. The wgSNP analysis confirmed the B. melitensis isolated from human was more closely related to the goat from the Western Cape Province from the same outbreak than the B. melitensis cattle sample from different cases in the Gauteng Province. The B. melitensis sable strains could be distinguished from the African lineage, constituting their own African sub-clade. The sequenced B. abortus strains clustered in the C2 lineage that is closely related to the isolates from Mozambique and Zimbabwe. This study identified genetically diverse Brucella spp. among various hosts in SA. This study expands the limited known knowledge regarding the presence of B. melitensis in livestock and humans in SA, further building a foundation for future research on the distribution of the Brucella spp. worldwide and its evolutionary background.

Title: Would you bet on the vet? Influences on dairy farmers' vaccination choices, with a spotlight on the Veterinarian impact.
Authors: Morgenstern Michal, Sok Jaap, Klement Eyal
DOI: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2024.106262
Abstract: Ensuring effective vaccination is crucial for epidemic control, particularly in voluntary vaccination scenarios. Though highly important for planning voluntary vaccination programs, we lack insights into the effectiveness of veterinarian communication and the impact of disease-specific traits on farmer vaccination intentions. To fill this void, our study compared five diseases affecting Israeli dairy cattle (Botulism, Bovine Ephemeral Fever (BEF), Brucellosis, Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), and Rabies). Using questionnaires grounded in the theory of planned behavior, we surveyed 340 Israeli dairy farmers to understand their vaccination intentions for each disease.Simultaneously, veterinarians overseeing these farms provided insights into their opinions and perceived influence on vaccination decisions. Results revealed varying levels of farmer vaccination intention, with Botulism showing the highest and BEF the lowest. Social pressure significantly influenced farmers' vaccination intentions, with distinct patterns across diseases. Veterinarian opinions had the highest influence only for LSD, while other factors played crucial roles in different diseases. Intriguingly, there was no correlation between veterinarians' recommendations and farmers' perceptions of these recommendations. In conclusion, the optimization of voluntary vaccination programs necessitates tailoring interventions to the unique characteristics of each disease. Additionally, improving communication between veterinarians and farmers is essential, with an emphasis on effective risk communication training.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a dangerous zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella. Diagnosis of brucellosis is based on the detection in animal and human sera of antibodies to the O-polysaccharide of Brucella lipopolysaccharide. The currently employed serodiagnosis of brucellosis relies on the use of the Brucella O-polysaccharide as a diagnostic antigen. However, the existence of bacterial species, which also express O-polysaccharides structurally similar to that of Brucella, may decrease the specificity of the brucellosis detection due to false-positive test results. It has been shown that the efficiency of the test can be significantly improved by using synthetic oligosaccharides that correspond to the so-called M epitope of the Brucella O-antigen. This epitope is characterized by an α-(1→3)-linkage between d-perosamine units and is unique to Brucella. Here we report on an efficient approach to the synthesis of oligosaccharides that model the M epitope of the Brucella O-polysaccharide. The approach is based on the use of the α-(1→3)-linked disaccharide thioglycoside as the key donor block. Its application allowed the straightforward assembly of a set of four protected oligosaccharides, which includes a disaccharide, two trisaccharides, and a tetrasaccharide, in five glycosylation steps. The synthesized oligosaccharides are planned to be used in the development of diagnostic tools for identifying brucellosis in humans and domestic animals, as well as a potential vaccine against it.

Abstract: Bovine brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella abortus, responsible for abortions in cows. It is endemic in low- and middle-income countries, where the brucellosis control and eradication programs are based on compulsory vaccination, detection of infected cattle through serologic assays, and culling of infected animals at slaughterhouses. The development of high sensitivity and specificity, and low-cost serologic assays guarantee their implementation in countries where the disease is endemic. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immune assay (ciELISA) to detect anti-B. abortus antibodies in sera from cattle. The developed ciELISA was validated using 2833 serum samples from dairy and beef cattle. From these, 1515 sera were from uninfected cows that belonged to free of brucellosis herds and 1318 were from infected cows that belonged positive to brucellosis herds. Sera were analyzed with the developed ciELISA, the buffer plate antigen (BPA) test, and the complement fixation test (CFT). The brucellosis status of the herds was officially established according to the country legislation and consistent for at least 5 years and was defined for each cow using the CFT as gold standard. The cutoff for the ciELISA was calculated using a ROC curve and its sensitivity and specificity were analyzed using the Bayesian Latent Class Model (BLCM) approach. The agreement among tests was calculated using the kappa (κ) value. In addition, 15 calves were vaccinated with 3 × 1010 viable cells of B. abortus Strain 19 vaccine, and the dynamics of antibodies were measured by CFT, buffered plate antigen (BPA) test, and the developed ciELISA. The obtained cutoff for ciELISA was ≥ 47 percentage of inhibition (% I), at the BLCM approach the sensitivity was 99.01 % (95 % CI: 97.55-100) and the specificity 98.74 % (95 % CI: 97.68-99.8). The κ between the ciELISA and BPA was κ = 0.88 and between the ciELISA and CFT κ = 0.95. Antibodies against B. abortus were detected in all the vaccinated calves 7 days after vaccination (AV) by the three assays, at day 135 AV all the calves were negative to CFT (15/15), 93.3 % (14/15) to ciELISA and 73.3 % (11/15) to BPA, and at day 190 AV all the calves were negative to the three assays. The developed ciELISA showed a very good performance, could detect the majority of vaccinated animals as negative after 135 days and could be used for the detection of anti-B. abortus antibodies in serum samples for the brucellosis control and eradication program.

Abstract: Brucella BP26 proves to be a highly immunogenic antigen with excellent specificity in brucellosis detection. In China, the authorized use of the Bp26-deleted vaccine M5ΔBP26 for preventing small ruminant brucellosis highlights the importance of developing accurate detection methods targeting BP26, particularly for the diagnosis of differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). Using the traditional mouse hybridoma technique, we successfully obtained 12 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting BP26. The efficacy of these mAbs in detecting various animal brucellosis cases using the competitive ELISA method was evaluated. Among them, only the E10 mAb exhibited significant efficiency, being inhibited by 100, 97.62, and 100% of brucellosis-positive sera from cattle, small ruminants, and canines, respectively. The E10-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) outperformed the BP26-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) in accuracy, particularly for cattle and small ruminant brucellosis, with cELISA sensitivity reaching 97.62% compared to 64.29% for iELISA for small ruminants. Although cELISA showed slightly lower specificity than iELISA, it still maintained high accuracy in canine brucellosis detection. The epitope of mAb E10 was identified in the amino acid sequence QPIYVYPDDKNNLKEPTITGY, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic antigen for brucellosis. In conclusion, the E10-based cELISA presents an effective means of detecting animal brucellosis, particularly significant for DIVA diagnosis in China, where the BP26-mutant vaccine is widely used.

Title: Detection and characterization of Brucella species in rodents: A threat for the persistence of brucellosis in livestock farms.
Authors: Dadar Maryam, Alamian Saeed
DOI: 10.1016/j.rvsc.2024.105339
Abstract: Brucellosis, caused by various Brucella species, poses a significant threat to global public health and livestock industries. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap concerning the presence of Brucella spp. in rodents on livestock farms in Iran. Both bacteriological and molecular surveys were conducted to assess the prevalence of Brucella spp. in these rodent populations. A total of 16 rodents were captured in four seropositive dairy cattle farms (n = 7) and two seropositive sheep farms (n = 9) and were then examined for the presence of the Brucella-infection. Five cow milk samples and 53 bovine lymph node samples from these farms were also tested for Brucella spp. Lymph node samples from dairy cattle farms contained 32 B. abortus biovar 3 isolates and one B. melitensis Rev1 vaccine isolate. The bacterial culture of rodents identified 12.5% of them (Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus) harboring Brucella strains in dairy cattle farms. The rodents had B. abortus biovar 3 and B. melitensis biovar 1, suggesting a reservoir for these bacteria. A two-step molecular assay, utilizing the Omp28 sequences in tissue samples of rodents, demonstrated that 68.75% (n = 11) of the tested rodents yielded positive results. Bruce-ladder PCR and wboA typing on isolated bacteria revealed a close relationship to field strain of Brucella species. The study reveals that rodents on seropositive livestock farms in Iran harbor Brucella spp., indicating a potential reservoir for these bacteria. This highlights the importance of monitoring rodent populations through the molecular and bacterial methods to manage and control brucellosis in livestock.

Abstract: Brucellosis is an important bacterial disease of livestock and the most common zoonotic disease. The current vaccines are effective but unsafe, as they result in animal abortions and are pathogenic to humans. Virus-like particles are being investigated as molecular scaffolds for foreign antigen presentation to the immune system. Here, we sought to develop a new-generation vaccine by presenting selected Brucella melitensis T cell epitopes on the surface of Orbivirus core-like particles (CLPs) and transiently expressing these chimeric particles in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We successfully demonstrated the assembly of five chimeric CLPs in N. benthamiana plants, with each CLP presenting a different T cell epitope. The safety and protective efficacy of three of the highest-yielding CLPs was investigated in a mouse model of brucellosis. All three plant-expressed chimeric CLPs were safe when inoculated into BALB/c mice at specific antigen doses. However, only one chimeric CLP induced protection against the virulent Brucella strain challenge equivalent to the protection induced by the commercial Rev1 vaccine. Here, we have successfully shown the assembly, safety and protective efficacy of plant-expressed chimeric CLPs presenting B. melitensis T cell epitopes. This is the first step in the development of a safe and efficacious subunit vaccine against brucellosis.

DOI: 10.1088/1361-6528/ad5b66
Abstract: Safe and effective vaccine candidates are needed to address the limitations of existing vaccines against Brucellosis, a disease responsible for substantial economic losses in livestock. The present study aimed to encapsulate recombinant Omp25 and EipB proteins, knowledged antigen properties, into PLGA nanoparticles, characterize synthesized nanoparticles with different methods, and assessed theirin vitro/in vivoimmunostimulatory activities to develop new vaccine candidates. The recombinant Omp25 and EipB proteins produced with recombinant DNA technology were encapsulated into PLGA nanoparticles by double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. The nanoparticles were characterized using FE-SEM, Zeta-sizer, and FT-IR instruments to determine size, morphology, zeta potentials, and polydispersity index values, as well as to analyze functional groups chemically. Additionally, the release profiles and encapsulation efficiencies were assessed using UV-Vis spectroscopy. After loading with recombinant proteins, O-NPs reached sizes of 221.2 ± 5.21 nm, while E-NPs reached sizes of 274.4 ± 9.51 nm. The cumulative release rates of the antigens, monitored until the end of day 14, were determined to be 90.39% for O-NPs and 56.1% for E-NPs. Following the assessment of thein vitrocytotoxicity and immunostimulatory effects of both proteins and nanoparticles on the J774 murine macrophage cells,in vivoimmunization experiments were conducted using concentrations of 16µg ml-1for each protein. Both free antigens and antigen-containing nanoparticles excessively induced humoral immunity by increasing producedBrucella-specific IgG antibody levels for 3 times in contrast to control. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that vaccine candidates stimulated Th1-mediated cellular immunity as well since they significantly raised IFN-gamma and IL-12 cytokine levels in murine splenocytes rather than IL-4 following to immunization. Additionally, the vaccine candidates conferred higher than 90% protection from the infection according to challenge results. Our findings reveal that PLGA nanoparticles constructed with the encapsulation of recombinant Omp25 or EipB proteins possess great potential to triggerBrucella-specific humoral and cellular immune response.

DOI: 10.1007/s00239-024-10173-0
Abstract: Brucellosis is a notifiable disease induced by a facultative intracellular Brucella pathogen. In this study, eight Brucella abortus and eighteen Brucella melitensis strains from Egypt were annotated and compared with RB51 and REV1 vaccines respectively. RAST toolkit in the BV-BRC server was used for annotation, revealing genome length of 3,250,377 bp and 3,285,803 bp, 3289 and 3323 CDS, 48 and 49 tRNA genes, the same number of rRNA (3) genes, 583 and 586 hypothetical proteins, 2697 and 2726 functional proteins for B. abortus and B. melitensis respectively. B. abortus strains exhibit a similar number of candidate genes, while B. melitensis strains showed some differences, especially in the SRR19520422 Faiyum strain. Also, B. melitensis clarified differences in antimicrobial resistance genes (KatG, FabL, MtrA, MtrB, OxyR, and VanO-type) in SRR19520319 Faiyum and (Erm C and Tet K) in SRR19520422 Faiyum strain. Additionally, the whole genome phylogeny analysis proved that all B. abortus strains were related to vaccinated animals and all B. melitensis strains of Menoufia clustered together and closely related to Gharbia, Dameitta, and Kafr Elshiek. The Bowtie2 tool identified 338 (eight B. abortus) and 4271 (eighteen B. melitensis) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) along the genomes. These variants had been annotated according to type and impact. Moreover, thirty candidate genes were predicted and submitted at GenBank (24 in B. abortus) and (6 in B. melitensis). This study contributes significant insights into genetic variation, virulence factors, and vaccine-related associations of Brucella pathogens, enhancing our knowledge of brucellosis epidemiology and evolution in Egypt.

Title: Rev1Δwzm vaccine candidate is safe in young and adult sheep and protects against Brucella ovis infection in rams.

DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.05.046
Abstract: Small ruminants affected by brucellosis, caused mainly by Brucella melitensis and B. ovis, suffer reproductive disorders, leading to significant economic losses worldwide. Vaccination is an essential tool to prevent the disease in ovine and caprine livestock, but the only vaccine recommended to date is B. melitensis Rev1, which in sheep is only safe for use in lambs aged 3-4 months. This restriction poses considerable practical challenges for the implementation of Rev1 in countries with endemic brucellosis and/or limited resources, where there is a need for mass vaccination with a safe vaccine to control the disease in both animals and humans. We recently developed a B. melitensis strain Rev1Δwzm showing superior vaccine properties in mice and safety in pregnant ewes. Here, we report that Rev1Δwzm (i) is safe in young and adult sheep, both male and female; (ii) induces a transient serological response in the Rose Bengal test in ≤50 % of sheep, confirmed to some extent by the complement fixation test, and a stronger, more persistent anti- rough-LPS response; and (iii) protects rams against a B. ovis challenge 25 weeks after vaccination. To resolve the problem of serological interference, the use of green fluorescent protein tagging strategy allowed us to identify vaccinated sheep with only a single inoculation. These results, together with the previously reported safety in pregnant ewes, position Rev1Δwzm as a firm vaccine candidate and a promising alternative to Rev1. Further experiments are warranted to assess its efficacy against B. melitensis in pregnant ewes.

Title: A Review on the Methodology and Use of the Pregnant Mouse Model in the Study of Brucella Reproductive Pathogenesis and Its Abortifacient Effect
Authors: Elizalde-Bielsa Aitor, Muñoz Pilar M, Zúñiga-Ripa Amaia, Conde-Álvarez Raquel
DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms12050866
Abstract: Brucellosis is one of the most common and widespread bacterial zoonoses and is caused by Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella. These organisms are able to infect and replicate within the placenta, resulting in abortion, one of the main clinical signs of brucellosis. Although the mouse model is widely used to study Brucella virulence and, more recently, to evaluate the protection of new vaccines, there is no clear consensus on the experimental conditions (e.g., mouse strains, doses, routes of inoculation, infection/pregnancy time) and the natural host reproducibility of the pregnant mouse model for reproductive brucellosis. This lack of consensus calls for a review that integrates the major findings regarding the effect of Brucella wild-type and vaccine strains infections on mouse pregnancy. We found sufficient evidence on the utility of the pregnant mouse model to study Brucella-induced placentitis and abortion and propose suitable experimental conditions (dose, time of infection) and pregnancy outcome readouts for B. abortus and B. melitensis studies. Finally, we discuss the utility and limitations of the pregnant mouse as a predictive model for the abortifacient effect of live Brucella vaccines.

DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-61991-7
Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease with significant economic and healthcare costs. Despite the eradication efforts, the disease persists. Vaccines prevent disease in animals while antibiotics cure humans with limitations. This study aims to design vaccines and drugs for brucellosis in animals and humans, using protein modeling, epitope prediction, and molecular docking of the target proteins (BvrR, OMP25, and OMP31). Tertiary structure models of three target proteins were constructed and assessed using RMSD, TM-score, C-score, Z-score, and ERRAT. The best models selected from AlphaFold and I-TASSER due to their superior performance according to CASP 12 - CASP 15 were chosen for further analysis. The motif analysis of best models using MotifFinder revealed two, five, and five protein binding motifs, however, the Motif Scan identified seven, six, and eight Post-Translational Modification sites (PTMs) in the BvrR, OMP25, and OMP31 proteins, respectively. Dominant B cell epitopes were predicted at (44-63, 85-93, 126-137, 193-205, and 208-237), (26-46, 52-71, 98-114, 142-155, and 183-200), and (29-45, 58-82, 119-142, 177-198, and 222-251) for the three target proteins. Additionally, cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes were detected at (173-181, 189-197, and 202-210), (61-69, 91-99, 159-167, and 181-189), and (3-11, 24-32, 167-175, and 216-224), while T helper lymphocyte epitopes were displayed at (39-53, 57-65, 150-158, 163-171), (79-87, 95-108, 115-123, 128-142, and 189-197), and (39-47, 109-123, 216-224, and 245-253), for the respective target protein. Furthermore, structure-based virtual screening of the ZINC and DrugBank databases using the docking MOE program was followed by ADMET analysis. The best five compounds of the ZINC database revealed docking scores ranged from (- 16.8744 to - 15.1922), (- 16.0424 to - 14.1645), and (- 14.7566 to - 13.3222) for the BvrR, OMP25, and OMP31, respectively. These compounds had good ADMET parameters and no cytotoxicity, while DrugBank compounds didn't meet Lipinski's rule criteria. Therefore, the five selected compounds from the ZINC20 databases may fulfill the pharmacokinetics and could be considered lead molecules for potentially inhibiting Brucella's proteins.

Abstract: Bovine brucellosis, an infectious disease transmitted by Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus, presents a significant zoonotic risk for agricultural economics and animal health. The primary objective of this study was to present a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and features of Brucella strains within the industrial dairy farming sector in Iran. Rose Bengal plate test, standard agglutination test, and indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay tests were used to confirm all seropositive animals. A total number of 1,311 bovine samples from seropositive animals including were collected from 224 farms in 21 provinces of different regions of Iran and examined. The discovered Brucella isolates were phenotyped and molecularly characterized. The isolates were all B. abortus or B. melitensis. Bacteria analysis revealed that 70.53% of seropositive farms were tested positive for Brucella strains, predominantly B. melitensis biovar 1 (43.42%) and B. abortus biovar 3 (27.11%). Geographical distribution revealed that B. melitensis biovar 1 was the most common in dairy cow farms (16 provinces), followed by B. abortus biovar 3 (six provinces). Also, the prevalence of B. melitensis biovar 2, B. melitensis biovar 3, B. abortus biovar 1, B. abortus biovar 2 and RB51 vaccine were restricted to certain provinces. AMOS (abortus melitensis ovis suis)-polymerase chain reaction and Bruce-ladder PCR confirmed species identification. These results highlighted the complexity of bovine brucellosis in Iran and illustrated that B. melitensis was spread from small ruminants to cattle. This study provided important epidemiological insights for targeting future brucellosis control programs in the Iranian dairy farms.

Title: Brucella melitensis Rev1Δwzm: Placental pathogenesis studies and safety in pregnant ewes.
Authors: Poveda-Urkixo Irati, Mena-Bueno Sara, Ramírez Gustavo A, Zabalza-Baranguá Ana, Tsolis Renee M, Grilló María-Jesús
DOI: 10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.04.085
Abstract: One of the main causes of human brucellosis is Brucella melitensis infecting small ruminants. To date, Rev1 is the only vaccine successfully used to control ovine and caprine brucellosis. However, it is pathogenic for pregnant animals, resulting in abortions and vaginal and milk shedding, as well as being infectious for humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine that is safer than Rev1. In efforts to further attenuate Rev1, we recently used wzm inactivation to generate a rough mutant (Rev1Δwzm) that retains a complete antigenic O-polysaccharide in the bacterial cytoplasm. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the placental pathogenicity of Rev1Δwzm in trophoblastic cells, throughout pregnancy in mice, and in ewes inoculated in different trimesters of pregnancy. This mutant was evaluated in comparison with the homologous 16MΔwzm derived from a virulent strain of B. melitensis and the naturally rough sheep pathogen B. ovis. Our results show that both wzm mutants triggered reduced cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and pro-inflammatory signaling in Bewo trophoblasts, as well as reduced relative expression of apoptosis genes. In mice, both wzm mutants produced infection but were rapidly cleared from the placenta, in which only Rev1Δwzm induced a low relative expression of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes. In the 66 inoculated ewes, Rev1Δwzm was safe and immunogenic, displaying a transient serological interference in standard RBT but not CFT S-LPS tests; this serological response was minimized by conjunctival administration. In conclusion, these results support that B. melitensis Rev1Δwzm is a promising vaccine candidate for use in pregnant ewes and its efficacy against B. melitensis and B. ovis infections in sheep warrants further study.

Title: Seroprevalence and risk factor analysis of brucellosis among dairy farmers in Aligarh region, North India: creating awareness of a neglected disease.
Authors: Alam Alveera, Sami Hiba, Hashmi S Zeeshan Ahmad, Gururaj K, Khan Mohammad Azam, Khan Parvez A, Ahmad Haleema, Fatima Nazish, Khan Haris M
DOI: 10.1099/acmi.0.000648.v3
Abstract: Introduction. Brucellosis, a globally distributed zoonotic disease, is caused by the Gram-negative bacteria known as Brucella. Humans acquire infection through direct contact with the blood, urine and placenta of animals, inhalation of dust or aerosols at infected animal farms, and raw milk and meat intake. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of brucellosis in dairy farmers in and around the Aligarh region of North India, to document various clinical signs and symptoms in Brucella-positive individuals, and to create awareness in dairy farmers concerning brucellosis and ways to prevent it. Methods. This was an observational study that included 125 dairy farmers in and around the Aligarh region. Serum samples were taken from this high-risk group after obtaining informed consent. Further, a pre-designed proforma was used to collect information about their knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) concerning brucellosis and assess the risk factors for the disease. The Rose Bengal test (RBT), serum agglutination test (SAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to detect the seroprevalence of brucellosis. Result.Brucella infection was diagnosed in 64 (51.20 %) cases by indirect ELISA (IgM+IgG), 41 (32.8 %) by RBT and 4 (3.2 %) by SAT. Significant clustering of patients was seen in the 20-55 years age group. The most common symptoms in ELISA IgM-positive patients were joint pain (16.07 %), fatigue (14.28 %), anorexia (12.50 %), weight loss (8.92 %), malaise (5.35 %), undulant fever (3.57 %), night sweats (3.57 %) and headache (1.78 %). The findings of this study indicate that ELISA (IgM+IgG) exhibits great sensitivity as compared to SAT and RBT. KAP was very poor among dairy farmers. Conclusion. In India, Brucella is a frequent but severely underreported illness. ELISA is the most sensitive serological test for diagnosing brucellosis. No potential vaccine has yet been introduced for humans against brucellosis. Thus, it is necessary to impart awareness and sensitize high-risk groups concerning brucellosis.

Title: Investigating the mechanism of rough phenotype in a naturally attenuated 
Authors: Han Wendong, Wei Dong, Sun Zhiping, Qu Di
DOI: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1363785
Abstract: Objective: Brucellosis, a significant zoonotic disease, not only impacts animal health but also profoundly influences the host immune responses through gut microbiome. Our research focuses on whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of these Brucella strains to understand the mechanisms of their virulence changes that may deepen our comprehension of the host immune dysregulation. Methods: The Brucella melitensis strain CMCC55210 and its naturally attenuated variant CMCC55210a were used as models. Biochemical identification tests and in vivo experiments in mice verified the characteristics of the strain. To understand the mechanism of attenuation, we then performed de novo sequencing of these two strains. Results: We discovered notable genomic differences between the two strains, with a key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutation in the manB gene potentially altering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure and influencing host immunity to the pathogen. This mutation might contribute to the attenuated strain's altered impact on the host's macrophage immune response, overing insights into the mechanisms of immune dysregulation linked to intracellular survival. Furthermore, we explore that manipulating the Type I restriction-modification system in Brucella can significantly impact its genome stability with the DNA damage response, consequently affecting the host's immune system. Conclusion: This study not only contributes to understanding the complex relationship between pathogens, and the immune system but also opens avenues for innovative therapeutic interventions in inflammatory diseases driven by microbial and immune dysregulation.

Abstract: Brucella infections typically occur in mucosal membranes, emphasizing the need for mucosal vaccinations. This study evaluated the effectiveness of orally administering Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for producing the Brucella abortus multi-epitope OMPs peptide. A multi-epitope plasmid was generated through a reverse vaccinology method, and mice were administered the genetically modified L. lactis orally as a vaccine. The plasmid underwent digestion, synthesizing a 39 kDa-sized protein known as OMPs by the target group. The sera of mice that were administered the pNZ8124-OMPs-L. lactis vaccine exhibited a notable presence of IgG1 antibodies specific to outer membrane proteins (OMPs), heightened levels of interferon (IFN-λ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and enhanced transcription rates of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The spleen sections from the pNZ8124-OMPs-L. lactis and IRIBA group had less morphological damage associated with inflammation, infiltration of lymphocytes, and lesions to the spleen. The findings present a novel approach to utilizing the food-grade, non-pathogenic L. lactis as a protein cell factory to synthesize innovative immunological candidate OMPs. This approach offers a distinctive way to evaluate experimental medicinal items' practicality, safety, affordability, and long-term sustainability.

Abstract: Background: Human brucellosis is a neglected disease transmitted to humans from animals such as cattle, goats, dogs, and swine. The causative agents are bacteria of the genus Brucella, intracellular pathogens usually confined to the reproductive organs of their animal hosts causing sterility and abortions. The objective of the study was to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis among women with spontaneous abortions (SAW) and compare this seroprevalence with that of healthy pregnant women (HPW). Methods: The case-control study was designed to determine the seroprevalence and molecular detection of brucellosis in women who suffered from spontaneous abortion and healthy pregnant women of the Haripur District of Pakistan. A total of 770 blood samples (n = 385 for each group) were collected from 9 public and 11 private hospitals in Haripur District from December 2021-March 2023. Data on demographic features, epidemiological variables, and risk factors were collected from each participant by structured questionnaires. Initial screening for brucellosis was performed by Rose Bengal Plate Test followed by qRT-PCR for molecular detection of the genus-specific BCSP-31 gene of Brucella. Results: The study showed that anti-Brucella antibodies were more found in SAW 23.63% (91/385) than in HPW 1.29% (5/385). Brucella specific DNA was amplified in 89.01% (81/91) seropositive samples of SAW. Demographic features and risk factors such as age, urbanicity, socioeconomic status, education, occupation, and animal contact were found significantly associated with brucellosis (p ≤ 0.05). Consumption of unpasteurized raw milk (OR = 18.28, 95%CI: 8.16-40.94) was found highly concomitant with seroprevalence.
Conclusion: This study reports the first evidence of involvement of brucellosis in spontaneous abortions in women of Pakistan. The study can be used to develop strategies for risk management during pregnancy, to raise awareness for brucellosis, and develop control programs.

Title: Brucellosis in hospitalized patients and their animals in the agro-pastoral region of Theniet El Had (Algeria) during ten years (2013-2023).
Authors: Yahiaoui Wafa Ilhem, Dahmani Ali
DOI: 10.1016/j.idcr.2024.e01945
Abstract: Introduction: Brucellosis is an important zoonosis problem worldwide. It's also recognized as a clinical and health problem in Algeria. Methods: This research is a descriptive study to determine the prevalence of brucellosis and some clinical and epidemiological aspects of hospitalized patients in the agro-pastoral region of Theniet El Had for ten years, between March 2013 and March 2023. During the study period, 180 patients (61.66% men and 38.33% women) with confirmed brucellosis based on clinical symptoms and serological tests were hospitalized for treatment. Patients working with animals were requested to screen their animals (383 goats from 27 suspicious farms with no history of vaccination), 16, 71% of goats from 44%, and 44% herds were infected. Results: The occurrence of human cases varied from 49.18 to 66.02pcm (cases/100,000 inhabitants) with an average of 58, 48pcm (cases/100,000 inhabitants). Almost half of hospitalized people who had been in contact with animals could have been contaminated by direct contact. Consumption of unpasteurized dairy products during the last 2 months was at the order of 95.55%. A family history of Brucellosis was observed in 36 (20%) patients. Brucella epididymo-orchitis occurred in 18.01% while relapse occurred in a small proportion of 7.22%. Conclusions: Local authorities should prevent human brucellosis with surveillance systems, disease declarations, biosecurity programs, and warning communities about the hazards of consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairy products.

Title: The immunostimulatory roles of gold nanoparticles in immunization and vaccination against Brucella abortus antigens.
Authors: Staroverov Sergey A, Vyrshchikov Roman D, Bogatyrev Vladimir A, Dykman Lev A
DOI: 10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112121
Abstract: One effective antigen carrier proposed for use in immunization and vaccination is gold nanoparticles. Prior work has shown that gold nanoparticles themselves have adjuvant properties. Currently, gold nanoparticles are used to design new diagnostic tests and vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. We investigated the use of gold nanoparticles as immunomodulators in immunization and vaccination with an antigen isolated from Brucella abortus. Gold nanoparticles with a diameter of 15 nm were synthesized for immunization of animals and were then conjugated to the isolated antigen. The conjugates were used to immunize white BALB/c mice. As a result, high-titer (1:10240) antibodies were produced. The respiratory and proliferative activities of immune cells were increased, as were the serum interleukin concentrations. The minimum antigen amount detected with the produced antibodies was ∼ 0.5 pg. The mice immunized with gold nanoparticles complexed with the B. abortus antigen were more resistant to B. abortus strain 82 than were the mice immunized through other schemes. This fact indicates that animal immunization with this conjugate enhances the effectiveness of the immune response. The results of this study are expected to be used in further work to examine the protective effect of gold nanoparticles complexed with the B. abortus antigen on immunized animals and to develop test systems for diagnosing brucellosis in the laboratory and in the field.

DOI: 10.5455/OVJ.2024.v14.i1.3
Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonotic disease caused by an intracellular facultative microorganism termed Brucella spp. Control of brucellosis depends on test and slaughter policy as well as vaccination programs. Aim: Estimation of the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) [total leukocytic count (TLC), phagocytic activity, phagocytic index, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)] in camels after vaccination with RB51 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods: A total of eight camels were grouped into two groups as follows: group (A): vaccinated with RB51 vaccine [1 dose/2 ml S/C (3 × 1010 CFU)] and group (B): control group. IL-6 and TNF-α were used for estimation of the CMI using real-time PCR on serum samples that were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 days after vaccination from each group. In addition, TLC, phagocytic activity, and phagocytic index were evaluated on heparinized blood samples at 0 and 60 days post-vaccination. Results: RB51 vaccine provides a protective immune response which progressively increases from the first week to 60 days after vaccination. Moreover, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 differed between camels in the vaccinated group. Conclusion: Vaccination of camels with RB51 vaccine (with dose 3 × 1010 CFU) could induce good protective immune responses and this immunological response will be a good indication for a safe field vaccine that can be used for the control of camel brucellosis.

Title: A novel gluconeogenic route enables efficient use of erythritol in zoonotic Brucella

DOI: 10.3389/fvets.2024.1328293
Abstract: Brucellosis is a worldwide extended zoonosis caused by pathogens of the genus Brucella. While most B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis biovars grow slowly in complex media, they multiply intensely in livestock genitals and placenta indicating high metabolic capacities. Mutant analyses in vitro and in infection models emphasize that erythritol (abundant in placenta and genitals) is a preferred substrate of brucellae, and suggest hexoses, pentoses, and gluconeogenic substrates use in host cells. While Brucella sugar and erythritol catabolic pathways are known, growth on 3-4 carbon substrates persists in Fbp- and GlpX-deleted mutants, the canonical gluconeogenic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6bP) bisphosphatases. Exploiting the prototrophic and fast-growing properties of B. suis biovar 5, we show that gluconeogenesis requires fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba); the existence of a novel broad substrate bisphosphatase (Bbp) active on sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate (S1,7bP), F1,6bP, and other phosphorylated substrates; that Brucella Fbp unexpectedly acts on S1,7bP and F1,6bP; and that, while active in B. abortus and B. melitensis, GlpX is disabled in B. suis biovar 5. Thus, two Fba-dependent reactions (dihydroxyacetone-phosphate + glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate ⇌ F1,6bP; and dihydroxyacetone-phosphate + erythrose 4-phosphate ⇌ S1,7bP) can, respectively, yield fructose 6-phosphate and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate for classical gluconeogenesis and the Pentose Phosphate Shunt (PPS), the latter reaction opening a new gluconeogenic route. Since erythritol generates the PPS-intermediate erythrose 4-phosphate, and the Fba/Fbp-Bbp route predicts sedoheptulose 7-phosphate generation from erythrose 4-phosphate, we re-examined the erythritol connections with PPS. Growth on erythritol required transaldolase or the Fba/Fbp-Bbp pathway, strongly suggesting that Fba/Fbp-Bbp works as a PPS entry for both erythritol and gluconeogenic substrates in Brucella. We propose that, by increasing erythritol channeling into PPS through these peculiar routes, brucellae proliferate in livestock genitals and placenta in the high numbers that cause abortion and infertility, and make brucellosis highly contagious. These findings could be the basis for developing attenuated brucellosis vaccines safer in pregnant animals.

Title: Vaccine Elicited Antibodies Restrict Glucose Availability to Control Brucella Infection.
Authors: Ponzilacqua-Silva Bárbara, Dadelahi Alexis S, Abushahba Mostafa F N, Moley Charles R, Skyberg Jerod A
DOI: 10.1093/infdis/jiae172
Abstract: The impact of vaccine-induced immune responses on host metabolite availability has not been well studied. Here we show prior vaccination alters the metabolic profile of mice challenged with Brucella melitensis. In particular, glucose levels were reduced in vaccinated mice in an antibody-dependent manner. We also found the glucose transporter gene, gluP, plays a lesser role in B. melitensis virulence in vaccinated wild-type mice relative to vaccinated mice unable to secrete antibodies. These data indicate vaccine-elicited antibodies protect the host in part by restricting glucose availability. Moreover, Brucella and other pathogens may need to employ different metabolic strategies in vaccinated hosts.

Title: Knowledge-attitude and practice of Anthrax and brucellosis: Implications for zoonotic disease surveillance and control in pastoral communities of Afar and Somali region, Ethiopia.
Authors: Tschopp Rea, Kidanu Ashenafi GebreGiorgis
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0012067
Abstract: Background: Anthrax and brucellosis are endemic national priority zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia. This study assess the possible factors explaining the current limited information available on animal and human cases in pastoral communities.  Methods: Two questionnaire surveys gathered data from 509 pastoralists and 51 healthcare providers between February and April 2019 in five districts of Afar and the Somali region (SRS). Results: Among the 51 healthcare providers, 25 (49%) and 38 (74.5%) had heard of brucellosis, and anthrax, respectively. Of those, only 3 (12%) and 14 (36.8%) knew the symptoms of brucellosis and Anthrax. None of the Health Extension Workers knew any disease symptoms. Healthcare providers recalled two human cases of brucellosis and 39 cases of Anthrax in the last 12 months, based on symptom-based diagnosis. Pastoralists had a moderate level of knowledge about diseases in their animals, with over half (52.4%; n = 267/509) understanding that animals can transmit diseases to people. Overall, 280 out of 508 (55.1%) and 333 out of 507 (65.7%) pastoralists had heard of brucellosis and Anthrax, respectively. Among the latter, 282 (51.3%) knew at least one preventive measure for Anthrax. However, disease knowledge among women was poor. Despite their knowledge, pastoralists engaged in risky unprotected animal handling, animal product consumption/usage as well as husbandry behaviors exposing them to pathogens and favoring the spread of diseases. They identified Anthrax as the most important zoonosis (47.6%) and as one of top three diseases suspected to cause mortality in their livestock. Pastoralists highlighted lack of vaccine coverage, availability and their timely administration. Both, pastoralists and healthcare providers stated the lack of disease awareness and the unavailability of drugs in the market as important challenges. Health facilities lacked protocols and standard operating procedures for managing zoonotic diseases, and did not have access to laboratory confirmation of pathogens. Conclusion: Our study revealed significant under-reporting of Anthrax and brucellosis, and weak prevention and response in humans, mostly associated with poor disease knowledge of healthcare providers. Ability to respond to animal outbreaks was limited by vaccine and drugs availability, timely vaccine administration and the mobility of pastoralists.

Abstract: Brucellosis is recognized as a significant global zoonotic infection that disproportionately affects low-income settings. A community cross-sectional survey was carried out in a rural setting of northwest Iran between February and May 2023. Rural individuals were interviewed according to a questionnaire with questions about demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to human brucellosis. We employed descriptive statistics to study knowledge, attitudes, and practice patterns. In addition, we applied a multivariable logistic regression model to assess potential predictors of knowledge, attitudes, and practice related to brucellosis using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Among 700 participants, 91.1% were aware of brucellosis, and 85.7% identified cows, sheep, and goats as primary transmission sources. 75.6% and 78.7% recognized transmission risks via unpasteurized and raw milk products. 60.5% understood the benefits of boiling milk and using gloves. Attitudinally, 64.3% perceived higher risk for livestock owners and supported practices like milk pasteurization (70.5%), protective gear (84.4%), handwashing (92.2%), and animal vaccination (71.0%). 90% expressed a need for more information. In practice, 44.8% exclusively consumed boiled and pasteurized milk, 37.8% consumed fresh cheese, and 92.2% solely consumed thoroughly cooked animal meat. Logistic regression revealed that higher education and no prior history of the disease correlated with good knowledge and attitudes, while older participants displayed inappropriate practices compared to their younger counterparts. This study highlights the reasonably high awareness of brucellosis, particularly regarding transmission sources and preventive measures. However, the gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and practices still exist, with education level emerging as a significant factor. To improve prevention practices, tailored interventions addressing age-related disparities are necessary.

Abstract: Brucella, a gram-negative intracellular bacterium, causing Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease with a range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, joint and muscle pain, and back pain, severe patients have developed serious diseases affecting various organs. The mRNA vaccine is an innovative type of vaccine that is anticipated to supplant traditional vaccines. It is widely utilized for preventing viral infections and for tumor immunotherapy. However, research regarding its effectiveness in preventing bacterial infections is limited. In this study, we analyzed the epitopes of two proteins of brucella, the TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor BtuB and the LPS assembly protein LptD, which is involved in nutrient transport and LPS synthesis in Brucella. In order to effectively stimulate cellular and humoral immunity, we utilize a range of immunoinformatics tools such as VaxiJen, AllergenFPv.1.0 and SignalP 5.0 to design proteins. Finally, five cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cell epitopes, ten helper T lymphocyte (HTL) cell epitopes, and eight B cell epitopes were selected to construct the vaccine. Computer simulations are also used to verify the immune response of the vaccine. The codon optimization, in silico cloning showed that the vaccine can efficiently transcript and translate in E. coli. The secondary structure of mRNA vaccines and the secondary and tertiary structures of vaccine peptides were predicted and then docked with TLR-4. Finally, the stability of the developed vaccine was confirmed through molecular dynamics simulation. These analyses showed that the design the multi-epitope mRNA vaccine could potentially target extracellular protein of prevalent Brucella, which provided novel strategies for developing the vaccine.

Title: Brucella infection and Toll-like receptors
Authors: Yu Hui, Gu Xinyi, Wang Danfeng, Wang Zhanli
DOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2024.1342684
Abstract: Brucella consists of gram-negative bacteria that have the ability to invade and replicate in professional and non-professional phagocytes, and its prolonged persistence in the host leads to brucellosis, a serious zoonosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the best-known sensors of microorganisms implicated in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In particular, TLRs are transmembrane proteins with a typical structure of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region and an intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. In this review, we discuss Brucella infection and the aspects of host immune responses induced by pathogens. Furthermore, we summarize the roles of TLRs in Brucella infection, with substantial emphasis on the molecular insights into its mechanisms of action.

DOI: 10.1016/j.chom.2024.03.003
Abstract: Many powerful methods have been employed to elucidate the global transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolic responses to pathogen-infected host cells. However, the host glycome responses to bacterial infection remain largely unexplored, and hence, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens manipulate the host glycome to favor infection remains incomplete. Here, we address this gap by performing a systematic analysis of the host glycome during infection by the bacterial pathogen Brucella spp. that cause brucellosis. We discover, surprisingly, that a Brucella effector protein (EP) Rhg1 induces global reprogramming of the host cell N-glycome by interacting with components of the oligosaccharide transferase complex that controls N-linked protein glycosylation, and Rhg1 regulates Brucella replication and tissue colonization in a mouse model of brucellosis, demonstrating that Brucella exploits the EP Rhg1 to reprogram the host N-glycome and promote bacterial intracellular parasitism, thereby providing a paradigm for bacterial control of host cell infection.

Abstract: The present study evaluates the effects of vaccination with Brucella melitensis strains Rev 1 ΔeryCD and Rev 1 on the reproductive system of male goats. Three groups, each of them consisting of 15 six-month-old brucellosis-free male goats, were studied. The first group was vaccinated with the Rev 1 ΔeryCD strain, the second group received Rev 1 and the third group was inoculated with sterile physiological saline solution. The dose of both strains was of 1×109CFU/ml. Over the course of the five months of this study, three males from each group were euthanized every month. Their reproductive tracts, spleens, and lymph nodes were collected to analyze serology, bacteriology PCR, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Results show that vaccination with B. melitensis strains Rev 1 ΔeryCD and Rev 1 does not harm the reproductive system of male goats. Strain B. melitensis Rev 1 ΔeryCD displayed a lower capacity to colonize the reproductive tract than strain Rev 1, which was attributed to its limited catabolic action toward erythritol.

Title: A subunit vaccine based on Brucella rBP26 induces Th1 immune responses and M1 macrophage activation

DOI: 10.3724/abbs.2024023
Abstract: Brucellosis is a global zoonotic infection caused by Brucella bacteria, which poses a significant burden on society. While transmission prevention is currently the most effective method, the absence of a licenced vaccine for humans necessitates the urgent development of a safe and effective vaccine. Recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines are considered promising options, and in this study, the Brucella BP26 protein is expressed using prokaryotic expression systems. The immune responses are evaluated using the well-established adjuvant CpG-ODN. The results demonstrate that rBP26 supplemented with a CpG adjuvant induces M1 macrophage polarization and stimulates cellular immune responses mediated by Th1 cells and CD8 + T cells. Additionally, it generates high levels of rBP26-specific antibodies in immunized mice. Furthermore, rBP26 immunization activates, proliferates, and produces cytokines in T lymphocytes while also maintaining immune memory for an extended period of time. These findings shed light on the potential biological function of rBP26, which is crucial for understanding brucellosis pathogenesis. Moreover, rBP26 holds promise as an effective subunit vaccine candidate for use in endemic areas.

Title: Equine brucellosis in Iran: serological, bacteriological and molecular analysis.
Authors: Amini Maryam, Alamian Saeed, Talebhemmat Mahdokht, Dadar Maryam
DOI: 10.1007/s11259-024-10332-0
Abstract: Equine brucellosis significantly impacts the health and functionality of horses, leading to complications such as bursitis infection, septic tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, and non-specific lameness resulting from joint infections. In the present study, we used the Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT), serum agglutination test (SAT), and the 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) assays to find equine brucellosis. From June 2018 to September 2022, 876 blood samples were randomly taken from apparently healthy racing horses in certain parts of Iran, such as Kerman, Isfahan, Tehran, Qom, and Kurdistan. DNA extraction was carried out directly on all 63 serum samples identified as seropositive through RBPT. An additional 30 seronegative serum samples were also randomly chosen for study. Bacterial culture was also done on milk, blood, and vaginal swabs taken from seropositive horses.The bacteria that were found in the samples were then put through Bruce-ladder PCR. Our results indicated that 63 (7.1%), 21 (2.3%), and 2 (0.2%) of horses were seropositive using RBPT, SAT, and 2-ME, respectively. Also, none of the 30 DNA-extracted serum samples from seronegative horses tested positive for Brucella DNA, while 44.5% (28/63) of the DNA samples from seropositive horses yielded positive results for Brucella DNA. Out of the seropositive samples, 26 had DNA from Brucella abortus and 2 had DNA from Brucella melitensis. Also, B. melitensis biovar 1 was found in two milk samples from mares in the provinces of Kerman and Isfahan. It was identified using classical biotyping, and molecular assays. It was seen that some of healthy racing horses in some parts of Iran had antibodies against Brucella. The bacteriology and PCR methodologies provide a more comprehensive and reliable means of identifying Brucella spp. infections in horse, especially when the RBPT test came back positive. This underscores the imperative for employing molecular, bacterial, and serological methods in the diagnosis and monitoring of this zoonotic infection. Additionally, this finding suggests that Brucella is being transmitted to equine hosts as a result of its presence in ruminants. The mechanism of transmission may involve interactions between infected ruminants and susceptible equines. This discovery is significant as it underscores the potential cross-species transmission of Brucella and highlights the importance of understanding and managing the spread of the pathogen in both ruminant and equine populations.

Title: Contrasting roles for IgM and B-cell MHCII expression in Brucella abortus S19 vaccine-mediated efficacy against B. melitensis infection

DOI: 10.1128/msphere.00750-23
Abstract: Brucellosis, caused by the bacterium Brucella, poses a significant global threat to both animal and human health. Although commercial live Brucella vaccines including S19, RB51, and Rev1 are available for animals, their unsuitability for human use and incomplete efficacy in animals necessitate the further study of vaccine-mediated immunity to Brucella. In this study, we employed in vivo B-cell depletion, as well as immunodeficient and transgenic mouse models, to comprehensively investigate the roles of B cells, antigen uptake and presentation, antibody production, and class switching in the context of S19-mediated immunity against brucellosis. We found that antibody production, and in particular secretory IgM plays a protective role in S19-mediated immunity against virulent Brucella melitensis early after the challenge in a manner associated with complement activation. While T follicular helper cell deficiency dampened IgG production and vaccine efficacy at later stages of the challenge, this effect appeared to be independent of antibody production and rather was associated with altered T-cell function. By contrast, B-cell MHCII expression negatively impacted vaccine efficacy at later timepoints after the challenge. In addition, B-cell depletion after vaccination, but before the challenge, enhanced S19-mediated protection against brucellosis, suggesting a deleterious role of B cells during the challenge phase. Collectively, our findings indicate antibody production is protective, while B-cell MHCII expression is deleterious, to live vaccine-mediated immunity against brucellosis.

Title: Knowledge, perceptions, and practices around zoonotic diseases among actors in the livestock trade in the Lake Victoria crescent ecosystem in East Africa.
Authors: Majiwa Hamilton, Bukachi Salome A, Omia Dalmas, Fèvre Eric M
DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1199664
Abstract: Zoonotic diseases such as anthrax, rabies, brucellosis, and Rift Valley fever pose a direct threat to health and undercut livelihoods in the communities in which they occur. A combination of anthropogenic and animal activities like migration and interaction with wildlife and their respective parasites and vectors drives the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic diseases. Consequently, One Health interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate social scientists can provide key insights into complex local perceptions. The approach calls for collaboration between the human and animal health sectors, including the sharing of disease surveillance data necessary to alleviate disease impacts. Livestock traders interact closely with livestock, which puts them at elevated risk of infection and creates conditions by which they may spread zoonotic disease. It is thus essential to examine practices among actors involved in the livestock trade to understand the most appropriate ways to mitigate these risks.

Title: Parenteral Vaccination with a Live Brucella melitensis Mutant Protects against Wild-Type B. melitensis 16M Challenge
Authors: Yang Xinghong, Goodwin Zakia I, Bhagyaraj Ella, Hoffman Carol, Pascual David W
DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms12010169
Abstract: Susceptibility to brucellosis remains prevalent, even in herds vaccinated with conventional vaccines. Efforts are underway to develop an improved brucellosis vaccine, and possibly a universal vaccine, given that Brucella species are highly homologous. To this end, two B. melitensis mutants were developed, znBM-lacZ (znBMZ) and znBM-mCherry (znBM-mC), and were tested for their ability to confer systemic immunity against virulent B. melitensis challenge. To assess the extent of their attenuation, bone-marrow-derived macrophages and human TF-1 myeloid cells were infected with both mutants, and the inability to replicate within these cells was noted. Mice infected with varying doses of znBM-mC cleared the brucellae within 6-10 weeks. To test for efficacy against systemic disease, groups of mice were vaccinated once by the intraperitoneal route with either znBMZ or B. abortus S19 vaccine. Relative to the PBS-dosed mice, znBMZ vaccination greatly reduced splenic brucellae colonization by ~25,000-fold compared to 700-fold for S19-vaccinated mice. Not surprisingly, both znBMZ and S19 strains induced IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells, yet only znBMZ induced IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells. While both strains induced CD4+ effector memory T cells (Tems), only znBMZ induced CD8+ Tems. Thus, these results show that the described znBM mutants are safe, able to elicit CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity without a boost, and highly effective, rendering them promising vaccine candidates for livestock.

Title: Evasion of host defense by Brucella
Authors: Yang Jinke, Wang Yue, Hou Yuanpan, Sun Mengyao, Xia Tian, Wu Xin
DOI: 10.1016/j.cellin.2023.100143
Abstract: Brucella, an adept intracellular pathogen, causes brucellosis, a zoonotic disease leading to significant global impacts on animal welfare and the economy. Regrettably, there is currently no approved and effective vaccine for human use. The ability of Brucella to evade host defenses is essential for establishing chronic infection and ensuring stable intracellular growth. Brucella employs various mechanisms to evade and undermine the innate and adaptive immune responses of the host through modulating the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), inflammatory responses, or the activation of immune cells like dendritic cells (DCs) to inhibit antigen presentation. Moreover, it regulates multiple cellular processes such as apoptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy to establish persistent infection within host cells. This review summarizes the recently discovered mechanisms employed by Brucella to subvert host immune responses and research progress on vaccines, with the aim of advancing our understanding of brucellosis and facilitating the development of more effective vaccines and therapeutic approaches against Brucella.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic infectious disease in western regions of Iran, especially in Hamedan province. Following the Famenin brucellosis cohort study, the main aim of the current study was the molecular detection of Brucella species (spp.) in sheep and goats from Famenin, Hamedan, Iran. A total of 23 Brucella-seropositive samples (sheep=21 and goats=2), which had been screened from 1,660 animals in the Famenin cohort study, were used to detect Brucella-DNA using the BCSP31 target gene and IS711 locus. In total, 20 of 23 samples were positive for Brucella infection by using specific primers. Additionally, Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) and Brucella abortus (B. abortus) were confirmed in 90% (n=18) and 10% (n=2) of positive samples, respectively. There was no sample with the co-infection of B. abortus and B. melitensis. In this study, B. abortus was isolated from one of the goat samples. This is the first report on Brucella spp. in animals in the region. It was found that B. melitensis is the dominant spp. responsible for brucellosis in animals from Famenin. Molecular techniques are reliable tools to detect Brucella infection, especially in cases without serology findings and conclusive results.

Title: Recombinant proteins production in Escherichia coli BL21 for vaccine applications: a cost estimation of potential industrial-scale production scenarios
Authors: Akmayan Ilkgul, Ozturk Abdullah Bilal, Ozbek Tulin
DOI: 10.1080/10826068.2023.2299495
Abstract: Recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic elevated research interest in microorganism-related diseases, and protective health application importance such as vaccination and immune promoter agents emerged. Among the production methods for proteins, recombinant technology is an efficient alternative and frequently preferred method. However, since the production and purification processes vary due to the protein nature, the effect of these differences on the cost remains ambiguous. In this study, brucellosis and its two important vaccine candidate proteins (rOmp25 and rEipB) with different properties were selected as models, and industrial-scale production processes were compared with the SuperPro Designer® for estimating the unit production cost. Simulation study showed raw material cost by roughly 60% was one of the barriers to lower-cost production and 52.5 and 559.8 $/g were estimated for rEipB and rOmp25, respectively.

Title: What risk do Brucella vaccines pose to humans? A systematic review of the scientific literature on occupational exposure.
Authors: Vives-Soto Manuel, Puerta-García Amparo, Rodríguez-Sánchez Esteban, Pereira José-Luis, Solera Javier
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0011889
Abstract: Background: Currently, vaccination of livestock with attenuated strains of Brucella remains an essential measure for controlling brucellosis, although these vaccines may be dangerous to humans. The aim of this study was to review the risk posed to humans by occupational exposure to vaccine strains and the measures that should be implemented to minimize this risk. Methods: This article reviewed the scientific literature indexed in PubMed up to September 30, 2023, following "the PRISMA guidelines". Special emphasis was placed on the vaccine strain used and the route of exposure. Non-occupational exposure to vaccine strains, intentional human inoculation, publications on exposure to wild strains, and secondary scientific sources were excluded from the study. Results: Nineteen primary reports were found and classified in three subgroups: safety accidents in vaccine factories that led to an outbreak (n = 2), survellaince studies on vaccine manufacturing workers with a serologic diagnosis of Brucella infection (n = 3), and publications of infection by vaccine strains during their administration, including case reports, records of occupational accidents and investigations of outbreaks in vaccination campaigns (n = 14). Although accidental exposure during vaccine manufacturing were uncommon, they could provoke large outbreaks through airborne spread with risk of spread to the neighboring population. Besides, despite strict protection measures, a percentage of vaccine manufacturing workers developed positive Brucella serology without clinical infection. The most frequent type of exposure with symptomatic infection was needle injury during vaccine administration. Prolonged contact with the pathogen, lack of information and a low adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) use in the work environment were commonly associated with infection. Conclusions: Brucella vaccines pose occupational risk of contagion to humans from their production to their administration to livestock, although morbidity is low and deaths were not reported. Recommended protective measures and active surveillance of exposed workers appeared to reduce this risk. It would be advisable to carry out observational studies and/or systematic registries using solid diagnostic criteria.

Abstract: Bovine brucellosis is an endemic disease in Brazil, and evidence-based assessments of the available literature on its seroprevalence and risk factors are limited. The aim of this study was to systematically review and summarize studies related to seroprevalence and risk factors of bovine brucellosis in the entire Brazil, in addition to comparing published data with the most recent official reports. Articles available in scientific databases and published between October 2006 and October 2021 were evaluated. Forty-five publications were included in the meta-analysis on the seroprevalence of brucellosis and 29 publications in the review on risk factors. The largest number of publications was found for the State of Mato Grosso do Sul (n=4), and the highest and lowest seroprevalences were observed in Acre (11%; 95% CI: 8.0-14.0%) and in the Federal District (0.4%; 95% CI: 0.2-0.7%). The main risk factors were the purchase of animals for breeding, vaccination, the number of heifers (female ≥2 years), the presence of calving paddocks and the occurrence of abortions. The need for new official studies has been suggested to determine the true prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Brazil, supported by the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Animal Brucellosis and Tuberculosis.

Title: Design of an oral vaccine using Lactococcus lactis against brucellosis: an in vitro and in vivo study.
Authors: Kazemi-Roudsari Mahsa, Doosti Abbas, Jami Mohammad-Saeid
DOI: 10.1186/s13568-023-01638-4
Abstract: Brucellosis is regarded as one of the world's most severe zoonotic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using recombinant Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) as a live vector to produce recombinant Brucella abortus (B. abortus) Omp10. The gene sequences were obtained from GenBank. The proteins' immunogenicity was assessed using Vaxijen. After confirming the cloning of the Omp10 gene in the pNZ8148 vector by enzymatic digestion and PCR, transformation into L. lactis was done. SDS-PAGE and western blot methods evaluated omp10 protein expression. Mice received oral recombinant L. lactis vaccines. IgG antibodies against Omp10 were tested using ELISA. Real-time PCR and ELISA were used to analyze cytokine responses. Survival rate and histopathological changes were evaluated after the challenge. Omp10 was chosen for its 1.5524 antigenicity score. Enzymatic digestion and PCR identified a 381-bp gene fragment. A 10 kDa band indicated the success of L. lactis transformation. Mice administered the L. lactis-pNZ8148-Omp10-Usp45 vaccination 14 days after priming showed significantly higher Omp10-specific total IgG and IgG1 (P < 0.001) than the PBS control group. The mice who received the L. lactis-pNZ8148-Omp10-Usp45 and IRBA vaccines had significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-4, and IL-10 in samples collected on days 14 and 28 (P < 0.001). Inflammatory response, morphological damage, alveolar edema, and lymphocyte infiltration were reduced in the target group. A recombinant L. lactis expressing the Omp10 protein was constructed as an oral Lactococcus-based vaccine and compared to live attenuated vaccines for future brucellosis investigations.

Authors: Qureshi Kamal A, Parvez Adil, Fahmy Nada A, Abdel Hady Bassant H, Kumar Shweta, Ganguly Anusmita, Atiya Akhtar, Elhassan Gamal O, Alfadly Saeed O, Parkkila Seppo, Aspatwar Ashok
DOI: 10.1080/07853890.2023.2295398
Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is a pervasive zoonotic disease caused by various Brucella species. It mainly affects livestock and wildlife and poses significant public health threats, especially in regions with suboptimal hygiene, food safety, and veterinary care standards. Human contractions occur by consuming contaminated animal products or interacting with infected animals. Objective: This study aims to provide an updated understanding of brucellosis, from its epidemiology and pathogenesis to diagnosis and treatment strategies. It emphasizes the importance of ongoing research, knowledge exchange, and interdisciplinary collaboration for effective disease control and prevention, highlighting its global health implications. Methods: Pathogenesis involves intricate interactions between bacteria and the host immune system, resulting in chronic infections characterized by diverse clinical manifestations. The diagnostic process is arduous owing to non-specific symptomatology and sampling challenges, necessitating a fusion of clinical and laboratory evaluations, including blood cultures, serological assays, and molecular methods. Management typically entails multiple antibiotics, although the rise in antibiotic-resistant Brucella strains poses a problem. Animal vaccination is a potential strategy to curb the spread of infection, particularly within livestock populations. Results: The study provides insights into the complex pathogenesis of brucellosis, the challenges in its diagnosis, and the management strategies involving antibiotic therapy and animal vaccination. It also highlights the emerging issue of antibiotic-resistant Brucella strains. Conclusions: In conclusion, brucellosis is a significant zoonotic disease with implications for public health. Efforts should be directed towards improved diagnostic methods, antibiotic stewardship to combat antibiotic resistance, and developing and implementing effective animal vaccination programs. Interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing research are crucial for addressing the global health implications of brucellosis.

DOI: 10.1155/2023/5885316
Abstract: Introduction: Brucellosis is prevalent in Mediterranean countries. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis and associated factors among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adult Syrian refugees who attended the Public Health Lab (PHL) in Al Mafraq governorate, during the period of May-June 2022 to obtain a health certificate, which is legally required to receive governmental authorization for employment in Jordan. Blood samples were obtained from participants and a serum specimen was tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against Brucella using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG kits (Vircell Microbiologists, Granada, Spain). Results: A total of 1562 Syrian refugees were enrolled in the study. Their ages ranged between 18 and 74 years, with a median age of 30 years at presentation. The majority were males (75.9%, n = 1186) and 24.1% (n = 376) were females. The Brucella ELISA IgG results were positive for 149 persons, with an overall seroprevalence rate of 9.5% (95% confidence interval: 8.0%-11.0%). Having animal-related occupations, residing outside refugee camps, consuming unpasteurized milk, handling animals or their tissues, and slaughtering animals within 6 months of study inclusion were significantly higher among the seropositive group. In the multivariate analysis, IgG-positive persons were 13 times more likely to report being diagnosed with brucellosis (OR = 13.1, 95% CI: 6.1-28.3; p ≤ 0.001). In addition, they were more likely to reside in the city of Al Mafraq, as opposed to a refugee camp (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.2; p = 0.025) and to have handled animals within 6 months of study inclusion (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1-8.9; p = 0.035). Conclusions: In conclusion, one-tenth of adult Syrian refugees were tested positive for Brucella ELISA IgG. Being diagnosed with brucellosis, residing in the city of Al Mafraq, as opposed to a refugee camp, and handling animals within 6 months of study inclusion were significantly associated with being positive for Brucella ELISA IgG. This study illustrates the need for improved brucellosis control measures via comprehensive vaccination of animals and enhanced laboratory detection and surveillance capacities, in addition to emphasizing the need for increased awareness sessions among Syrian refugees on the safe use and preparation of dairy products and safety practices of handling animals and their tissues.

Abstract: Brucellosis, a zoonosis caused by Brucella, is highly detrimental to both humans and animals. Most existing vaccines are live attenuated vaccines with safety flaws for people and animals. Therefore, it is advantageous to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine (MEV) to prevent Brucella infection. To this end, we applied a reverse vaccinology approach. Six cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes, seven T helper cell (HTL) epitopes, and four linear B cell epitopes from CU/ZN-SOD, Omp31, and BP26 were obtained. We linked the CTL, HTL, B-cell epitopes, the appropriate CTB molecular adjuvant, and the universal T helper lymphocyte epitope, PADRE, with linkers AAY, GPPGG, and KK, respectively. This yielded a 412-amino acid MEV construct, which we named MEVcob. The immunogenicity, stability, safety, and feasibility of the construct were evaluated by bioinformatics tools (including the AlphaFold2 prediction tool, the AlphaFold2 tool, NetMHC-I pan 4.0 server, IEDB MHC-I server, ABCpred service, and C-ImmSim server); the physicochemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, and binding ability of MEVocb to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was analyzed. Then, codon adaptation and computer cloning studies were performed. MEVocb is highly immunogenic in immunostimulation experiments, The proteins translated by these sequences were relatively stable, exhibiting a high antigenic index. Furthermore, mouse experiments confirmed that the MEVocb construct could raise IFN-γ, IgG, IgG2a, IgG1, IL-2, TNF-α levels in mice, indicating that induced a specific humoral and cellular immune response in BALB/c mice. This vaccine induced a statistically significant level of protection in BALB/c mice when challenged with Brucella melitensis 043 in Xinjiang. Briefly, we utilized immunoinformatic tools to design a novel multi-epitope subunit candidate vaccine against Brucella. This vaccine aims to induce host immune responses and confer specific protective effects. The study results offer a theoretical foundation for the development of a novel Brucella subunit vaccine.

DOI: 10.1016/j.mimet.2023.106874
Abstract: The objective of this study was to validate an indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (iELISA) using the recombinant proteins, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) [CuZn], as antigens and to evaluate its ability to discriminate antibodies produced by vaccination from those induced by infection in the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis. Sera from six groups were evaluated: G1 - culture-positive animals (52 serum samples) (naturally infected); G2 - non-vaccinated animals (28 serum samples) positive in RBT (Rose Bengal test) and 2ME (2-mercaptoethanol test) selected from brucellosis-positive herds; G3 - animals from a brucellosis-free area (32 serum samples); G4 - S19 vaccinated heifers (114 serum samples); G5 - RB51 vaccinated heifers (60 serum samples); G6 - animals inoculated with inactivated Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 (42 serum samples). Diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and diagnostic specificity (DSp) were estimated using the frequentist approach and the confidence interval (CI) (95%) calculated by the Clopper-Pearson (exact) method. The DSe for iELISA_MDH in the G1 group was 71.7% (CI 95%: 57.6-83.2%) and for the G2 100.0% (CI 95%: 87.7-100.0%), whereas the DSp was 84.4% in the G3 (CI 95%: 67.2-94.7%). For the iELISA_SOD the DSe was estimated 67.3% for the G1 (CI 95%: 52.9-79.7%) and 71.4% for G2 (CI 95%: 51.3-86.8%), while the DSp for G3 was 87.5% (CI 95%: 71.0-96.5%). iELISA_MDH and iELISA_SOD showed potential to be used in the diagnosis of infected animals, increasing the range of serological tests available for the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis, with the advantage of being S-LPS-free. However, none of the tests could differentiate between infection and vaccination.

Abstract: A considerable body of evidence has reported the beneficial effects of improving productivity on reducing environmental impacts from livestock production. However, despite the negative impacts of animal diseases on reproduction, growth and milk production, there is little information available upon the impacts of animal disease on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe). This study aimed to partially address this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of globally important vaccine-preventable diseases on GHGe from various livestock systems, namely: intensive dairy, extensive beef, commercial swine and backyard poultry production.

Title: Investigation of the Proportion of Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis in Sheep and Goat Milk
Authors: Rostami Saeid, Rashidian Ehsan, Jaydari Amin, Rahimi Heidar
DOI: 10.1155/2023/6751152
Abstract: Despite the implementation of brucellosis eradication programs in Iran, this disease is still endemic and highly prevalent among ruminants in this country. The infection of small ruminants with Brucella abortus may play a significant role in the continuation of brucellosis among the herds of ruminants. This study investigated the proportion of B. abortus and Brucella melitensis in 150 samples of sheep and goat's raw milk which were obtained from Lorestan and Hamadan provinces in the western part of Iran using the PCR method. The results revealed that among the Brucella spp. positive samples, 26.5% and 73.4% of the samples were infected with B. abortus and B. melitensis, respectively. The incidence rates of B. abortus among the sheep and goats samples were 6.8% and 12.5%, respectively. There was a significant difference between goats and sheep regarding the proportion of B. abortus. Three samples (2%) (2 goats and one sheep) were simultaneously infected with both B. melitensis and B. abortus. This article renews our knowledge about the causative agent of brucellosis in small ruminants and shows that B. abortus has a relatively high prevalence among those animals in the western regions of Iran, and its role as one of the main factors of abortion among small ruminants should not be ignored. The information provided in the present study is important for the surveillance program, as eradication programs and strategies to prevent the spread of B. abortus among small ruminants that have not been vaccinated against this microorganism may be adapted accordingly.

Title: The Control Program of Brucellosis by the Iranian Veterinary Organization in Industrial Dairy Cattle Farms.
Authors: Alamian S, Bahreinipour A, Amiry K, Dadar M
DOI: 10.22092/ARI.2022.360508.2586
Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection in livestock that induces a major public health concern in developing countries, including Iran. Despite the efforts of the Iranian veterinary organization (IVO) to control brucellosis, it is still prevalent in domestic animals. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the control strategy used by the IVO in infected herds on serological, cultural, and molecular methods. For this purpose, blood specimens were sampled from a total of 8750 vaccinated dairy cattle in two Brucella-infected farms. These farms were recognized as positive for Brucella by a screening program. Sera were evaluated by the Rose Bengal Plate Test and Wright test analysis. Positive dairy cattle were slaughtered under IVO supervision. The remaining cattle were evaluated every 3 weeks and positive animals were slaughtered. This procedure continued until the remaining animals revealed three successive negative responses in serological tests. Several lymph nodes and milk samples were collected from 164 seropositive cattle and subjected to bacterial isolation and confirmation by Bruceladder-polymerase chain reaction. Brucella melitensis biovar 1 and RB51 vaccine strains were recovered from milk and lymph node samples, respectively. Shedding of B. melitensis in the milk of vaccinated cows is a serious problem resulting in the further spread of brucellosis. The policy of "test and slaughter" performed on infected dairy cattle farms showed their usefulness for the control of brucellosis outbreaks. For the uncontrolled spread of brucellosis in Iran, effective control of bovine brucellosis required several serological surveillances to identify infected herds, eradication of the reservoirs, and vaccination of young heifers with RB51.

Authors: Goudarzi Tahereh, Abkar Morteza, Zamanzadeh Zahra, Fasihi-Ramandi Mahdi
DOI: 10.7774/cevr.2023.12.4.304
Abstract: Purpose: Due to the many problems with commercially available vaccines, the production of effective vaccines against brucellosis is a necessity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune responses caused by the chimeric protein consisting of trigger factor, Bp26, and Omp31 (TBO) along with aluminum hydroxide (AH/TBO) and selenium (Se/TBO) nanoparticles (NPs) as adjuvants in mouse model.Materials and methods: Recombinant antigen expression was induced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bacteria using IPTG (isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside). Purification and characterization of recombinant protein was conducted through NiFe3O4 NPs, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blot. NP characteristics, including morphology and particle size, were measured in vitro. The recombinant TBO was loaded on to AH and Se NPs and were administered subcutaneously. After mice immunization, measurement of antibody titter and protection assay was performed. Results: The average sizes of AH and Se NPs were about 60 nm and 150 nm, respectively. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the serum of mice immunized by subcutaneous injection with both nanovaccines produced significant immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses against the chimeric antigen. The results of TBO-specific IgG isotype (IgG2a/IgG1) analysis showed that both AH and Se NPs induced a type to T-helper immune response. In addition, the results of the challenge with the pathogenic strain of Brucella melitensis 16M showed that vaccinated mice with AH/TBO NPs indicated a higher reduction of bacterial culture than immunized mice with Se/TBO NPs and TBO alone.

DOI: 10.14202/vetworld.2023.2080-2085
Abstract: The diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in animals vaccinated with strain-19 (S19) and Rose Bengal (RB)-51 strain vaccines can be misinterpreted due to false positives. This study aimed to compare diagnostic tests for detecting bovine brucellosis in animals vaccinated with S19 and RB51 vaccine strains.  Two groups of 12 crossbred Holstein calves between 6 and 8 months of age were used. On day 0, blood samples were collected from the animals, and the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for serological diagnosis of bovine Brucellosis. All animals tested negative. After the first blood collection, the animals were subcutaneously vaccinated: one group received the S19 vaccine and the other received the RB51 vaccine. From the 3rd month after vaccination, all animals were sampled. Sampling was repeated every 2 months until the 7th month. Serological diagnosis of bovine brucellosis was performed using RB, tube serum agglutination test (SAT), SAT with 2-mercaptoethanol (SAT-2Me), and fluorescence polarization assay (FPA). Animals vaccinated with S19 showed positive results with the RB, SAT, and SAT-2Me tests in all months of post-vaccination diagnosis. In animals vaccinated with S19, FPA showed positive results at months 3 and 5 and negative results at month 7, indicating that this test discriminates vaccinated animals from infected animals 7 months after vaccination. Rose Bengal, SAT, SAT-2Me, and FPA tests showed negative results in animals vaccinated with RB51 in all months of diagnosis. Animals vaccinated with S19 may test positive for brucellosis using RB, SAT, or SAT-2Me tests 7 months later. Fluorescence polarization assay is an optimal alternative for diagnosing animals in the field, thereby preventing false positives, and consequently, unnecessary confiscations of animals. Animals vaccinated with RB51 tested negative with RB, SAT, SAT-2Me, and FPA tests in all months of diagnosis, confirming that the tests are ineffective for diagnosing brucellosis caused by rough strains.

Title: Immunoinformatics analysis of Brucella melitensis to approach a suitable vaccine against brucellosis.
Authors: Hashemzadeh Pejman, Nezhad Saba Asgari, Khoshkhabar Hossein
DOI: 10.1186/s43141-023-00614-6
Abstract: Brucellosis caused by B. melitensis is one of the most important common diseases between humans and livestock. Currently, live attenuated vaccines are used for this disease, which causes many problems, and unfortunately, there is no effective vaccine for human brucellosis. The aim of our research was to design a recombinant vaccine containing potential immunogenic epitopes against B. melitensis.In this study, using immunoinformatics approaches, 3 antigens Omp31, Omp25, and Omp28 were identified and the amino acid sequence of the selected antigens was determined in NCBI. Signal peptides were predicted by SignaIP-5.0 server. To predict B-cell epitopes from ABCpred and Bcepred servers, to predict MHC-I epitopes from RANKPEP and SYFPEITHI servers, to predict MHC-II epitopes from RANKPEP and MHCPred servers, and to predict CTL epitopes were used from the CTLPred server. Potentially immunogenic final epitopes were joined by flexible linkers. Finally, allergenicity (AllerTOP 2.0 server), antigenicity (Vaxijen server), physicochemical properties (ProtParam server), solubility (Protein-sol server), secondary (PSIPRED and GRO4 servers) and tertiary structure (I-TASSER server), refinement (GalaxyWEB server), validation (ProSA-web, Molprobity, and ERRAT servers), and optimization of the codon sequence (JCat server) of the structure of the multi-epitope vaccine were analyzed. The analysis of immunoinformatics tools showed that the designed vaccine has high quality, acceptable physicochemical properties, and can induce humoral and cellular immune responses against B. melitensis bacteria. In addition, the high expression level of recombinant antigens in the E. coli host was observed through in silico simulation.

Title: Detection of Virulence-Associated Genes among Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus Clinical Isolates in Greece, 2001-2022
Authors: Papaparaskevas Joseph, Procopiou Alexandra, Routsias John, Vrioni Georgia, Tsakris Athanasios
DOI: 10.3390/pathogens12111274
Abstract: Brucellosis remains an important zoonotic disease in several parts of the world; in Greece, although it is declining, it is still endemic, affecting both the financial and public health sectors. The current study was undertaken to investigate the presence and distribution of virulence-associated genes among Brucella spp. clinical strains isolated during 2001-2022. Species identification was performed using conventional methodology and Bruce-ladder PCR. The presence of the virulence genes mviN, manA, wbkA, perA, omp19, ure, cbg and virB was investigated using PCR. During the study period, a total of 334 Brucella isolates were identified, of which 328 (98.2%) were detected from positive blood cultures; 315 (94.3%) of the isolates were identified as B. melitensis, whilst the remaining 16 (4.8%) and 3 (0.9%) were identified as B. abortus and B. suis, respectively. Notably, two of the B. melitensis were assigned to the REV-1 vaccine strain type. The presence of the omp19, manA, mviN and perA genes was confirmed in all 315 B. melitensis isolates, while ure, wbkA, cbg and virB genes were detected in all but 9, 2, 1 and 1 of the isolates, respectively. All eight virulence genes were amplified in all B. abortus and B. suis isolates. The detection rate of virulence genes did not differ significantly among species. In conclusion, brucellosis is still considered a prevailing zoonotic disease in Greece, with the majority of the isolates identified as B. melitensis. The eight pathogenicity-associated genes were present in almost all Brucella isolates, although the ure gene was absent from a limited number of B. melitensis isolates.

Title: One-step preparation of a self-assembled bioconjugate nanovaccine against Brucella
Authors: Huang Jing, Guo Yan, Yu Shujuan, Wang Dongshu, Li Shulei, Wu Jun, Sun Peng, Zhu Li, Wang Hengliang, Pan Chao
DOI: 10.1080/21505594.2023.2280377
Abstract: Brucellosis, caused by Brucella, is a severe zoonosis, and the current Brucella live attenuated vaccine cannot be used in humans due to major safety risks. Although polysaccharide antigens can be used to prepare the Brucella vaccine, their lower immunogenicity limits them from producing efficient and broad protection. In this study, we produced a high-performance bioconjugate nanovaccine against different species of Brucella by introducing a self-assembly nanoparticle platform and an O-linked glycosylation system into Yersinia enterocolitica serotype O:9, which has an O-polysaccharide composed of the same unit as Brucella. After successfully preparing the vaccine and confirming its stability, we subsequently demonstrated the safety of the vaccine in mice by high-dose immunization. Then, by a series of mouse experiments, we found that the nanovaccine greatly promoted antibody responses. In particular, the increase of IgG2a was more obvious than that of IgG1. Most importantly, this nanovaccine could provide cross-protection against B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis strains by lethal dose challenged models, and could improve the clearance of B. melitensis, the most common pathogenic species in human brucellosis, by non-lethal dose infection. Overall, for the first time, we biocoupled polysaccharide antigens with nano carriers to prepare a Brucella vaccine, which showed pronounced and extensive protective effects in mice. Thus, we provided a potential candidate vaccine and a new direction for Brucella vaccine design.

Abstract: Brucella, a type of intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, has unique features and acts as a zoonotic pathogen. It can lead to abortion and infertility in animals. Eliminating brucellosis becomes very challenging once it spreads among both humans and animals, putting a heavy burden on livestock and people worldwide. Given the increasing spread of brucellosis, it is crucial to develop improved vaccines for susceptible animals to reduce the disease's impact. In this study, we effectively used an immunoinformatics approach with advanced computer software to carefully identify and analyze important antigenic parts of Brucella abortus. Subsequently, we skillfully designed chimeric peptides to enhance the vaccine's strength and effectiveness. We used computer programs to find four important parts of the Brucella bacteria that our immune system recognizes. Then, we carefully looked for eight parts that are recognized by a type of white blood cell called cytotoxic T cells, six parts recognized by T helper cells, and four parts recognized by B cells. We connected these parts together using a special link, creating a strong new vaccine. To make the vaccine even better, we added some extra parts called molecular adjuvants. These included something called human β-defensins 3 (hBD-3) that we found in a database, and another part that helps the immune system called PADRE. We attached these extra parts to the beginning of the vaccine. In a new and clever way, we made the vaccine even stronger by attaching a part from a mouse's immune system to the end of it. This created a new kind of vaccine called MEV-Fc. We used advanced computer methods to study how well the MEV-Fc vaccine interacts with certain receptors in the body (TLR-2 and TLR-4). In the end, Immunosimulation predictions showed that the MEV-Fc vaccine can make the immune system respond strongly, both in terms of cells and antibodies.

Abstract: Brucellosis is considered one of the most hazardous zoonotic diseases all over the world. It causes formidable economic losses in developed and developing countries. Despite the significant attempts to get rid of Brucella pathogens in many parts of the world, the disease continues to spread widely. Recently, many attempts proved to be effective for the prevention and control of highly contagious bovine brucellosis, which could be followed by others to achieve a prosperous future without rampant Brucella pathogens. In this study, the updated view for worldwide Brucella distribution, possible predisposing factors for emerging Brucella pathogens, immune response and different types of Brucella vaccines, genomics and proteomics approaches incorporated recently in the field of brucellosis, and future perspectives for prevention and control of bovine brucellosis have been discussed comprehensively. So, the current study will be used as a guide for researchers in planning their future work, which will pave the way for a new world without these highly contagious pathogens that have been infecting and threatening the health of humans and terrestrial animals.

DOI: 10.1016/j.micpath.2023.106417
Abstract: The gram-negative intracellular bacterium Brucella abortus causes bovine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that costs a lot of money. This work developed a vector vaccine against brucellosis utilizing recombinant L. lactis expressing Brucella outer membrane protein BAB1-0278. Gene sequences were obtained from GenBank. The proteins' immunogenicity was tested with Vaxijen. The target vector was converted into L. lactis after enzymatic digestion and PCR validated the BAB1-0278 gene cloning in the pNZ8148 vector. The target protein was extracted using a Ni-NTA column and confirmed using SDS-PAGE and western blot. After vaccination with the target vaccine, the expression of IgG subclasses was evaluated by the ELISA method. Cytokine production was also measured by the qPCR method in the small intestine and spleen. Lymphocyte proliferation and innate immune response (NLR, CRP, and PLR) were also assessed. Finally, after the challenge test, the spleen tissue was examined by H&E staining. BAB1-0278 was chosen because of its antigenicity score of 0.5614. A 237-bp gene fragment was discovered using enzymatic digestion and PCR. The presence of a 13 kDa protein band was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. In comparison to the PBS group, mice given the L. lactis-pNZ8148-BAB1-0278-Usp45 vaccine 14 days after priming had substantially greater levels of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a (P < 0.001). Also, the production of cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-4, and IL-10) indicating cellular immunity increased compared to the control group (P < 0.001). The target group had a lower inflammatory response, morphological impairment, alveolar edema, and lymphocyte infiltration. An efficient probiotic-based oral brucellosis vaccination was created. These studies have proven that the recommended immunization gives the best protection, which supports its promotion.

Title: Immuno-profiling of Brucella proteins for developing improved vaccines and DIVA capable serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis

Abstract: Brucellosis remains a worldwide zoonotic disease with a serious impact on public health and livestock productivity. Controlling brucellosis in livestock is crucial for limiting human infections in the absence of effective human vaccines. Brucellosis control measures are majorly dependent on rigorous monitoring of disease outbreaks and mass vaccination of livestock. Live attenuated vaccines are available for livestock vaccination that play a vital role in brucellosis control programs in many countries. Even though the existing animal vaccines confer protection against brucellosis, they carry some drawbacks, including their infectivity to humans and interference with sero-monitoring. The available serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis depend on detecting anti-LPS antibodies in the serum. Since diagnosis plays a vital role in controlling brucellosis, developing improved serodiagnostic assays with enhanced specificity, sensitivity and DIVA capability is required. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel antigens for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. In the present study, we performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of B. melitensis protein microarray using brucellosis-positive human and animal serum samples. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of Brucella that exhibited common or differential reactivity with sera from animals and humans. Subsequently, we cloned, expressed, and purified ten serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their potential to develop next-generation vaccines and improved serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Further, we demonstrated the protective efficacy of one of the serodominant proteins against the B. melitensis challenge in mice. We found that the seroreactive protein, Dps (BMEI1980), strongly reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples, but it did not react with sera from B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle, indicating DIVA capability. A prototype lateral flow assay and indirect ELISA based on Dps protein exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability. Thus, the present study identified promising candidates for developing improved vaccines and affordable, DIVA-capable serodiagnostic assays for animal and human brucellosis.

Title: A review of three decades of use of the cattle brucellosis rough vaccine Brucella abortus RB51: myths and facts.
Authors: Blasco J M, Moreno E, Muñoz P M, Conde-Álvarez R, Moriyón I
DOI: 10.1186/s12917-023-03773-3
Abstract: Cattle brucellosis is a severe zoonosis of worldwide distribution caused by Brucella abortus and B. melitensis. In some countries with appropriate infrastructure, animal tagging and movement control, eradication was possible through efficient diagnosis and vaccination with B. abortus S19, usually combined with test-and-slaughter (T/S). Although S19 elicits anti-smooth lipopolysaccharide antibodies that may interfere in the differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA), this issue is minimized using appropriate S19 vaccination protocols and irrelevant when high-prevalence makes mass vaccination necessary or when eradication requisites are not met. However, S19 has been broadly replaced by vaccine RB51 (a rifampin-resistant rough mutant) as it is widely accepted that is DIVA, safe and as protective as S19. These RB51 properties are critically reviewed here using the evidence accumulated in the last 35 years. Controlled experiments and field evidence shows that RB51 interferes in immunosorbent assays (iELISA, cELISA and others) and in complement fixation, issues accentuated by revaccinating animals previously immunized with RB51 or S19. Moreover, contacts with virulent brucellae elicit anti-smooth lipopolysaccharide antibodies in RB51 vaccinated animals. Thus, accepting that RB51 is truly DIVA results in extended diagnostic confusions and, when combined with T/S, unnecessary over-culling. Studies supporting the safety of RB51 are flawed and, on the contrary, there is solid evidence that RB51 is excreted in milk and abortifacient in pregnant animals, thus being released in abortions and vaginal fluids. These problems are accentuated by the RB51 virulence in humans, lack diagnostic serological tests detecting these infections and RB51 rifampicin resistance. In controlled experiments, protection by RB51 compares unfavorably with S19 and lasts less than four years with no evidence that RB51-revaccination bolsters immunity, and field studies reporting its usefulness are flawed. There is no evidence that RB51 protects cattle against B. melitensis, infection common when raised together with small ruminants. Finally, data acumulated during cattle brucellosis eradication in Spain shows that S19-T/S is far more efficacious than RB51-T/S, which does not differ from T/S alone. We conclude that the assumption that RB51 is DIVA, safe, and efficaceous results from the uncritical repetition of imperfectly examined evidence, and advise against its use.

DOI: 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2023.116079
Abstract: To evaluate the brucellosis detection of the dipstick assay coated with LPS antigen from Brucella melitensis vaccine strain M5 compared with Rose Bengal test (RB) and serum agglutination test (SAT), and investigate the brucella infection with the dipstick assay among people with unexplained fever in farming-pastoral areas of Xinjiang, China. The dipstick assay was repeated to verify 130 positive and 200 negative serum samples, which had been confirmed by RB and SAT, for sensitivity and specificity analysis. Subsequently, 313 sera from people with unexplained fever in farming-pastoral areas including 6 counties in 3 regions where brucellosis is endemic and 200 sera from nonendemic city area (Urumqi City) in Xinjiang were detected with the dipstick assay for population infection rate survey.Sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 97% respectively with dipstick assay compared with RB and SAT. The average positive rate of sera from people with unexplained fever from farming-pastoral areas in Xinjiang was 18.5% (58/313) and the highest was 22.5% (9/40).  The proportion of brucellosis infection among individuals with fever of unknown origin is relatively high in agricultural and pastoral areas of Xinjiang. The dipstick assay has a series of advantages such as low cost and fast speed, which make it suitable for the primary screening of high-risk populations.

DOI: 10.1080/21505594.2023.2268496
Abstract: Brucellosis is a major threat to public health and animal husbandry. Several in vivo vertebrate models, such as mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates, have been used to study Brucella pathogenesis, bacteria-host interactions, and vaccine efficacy. However, these models have limitations whereas the invertebrate Galleria mellonella model is a cost-effective and ethical alternative. The aim of the present study was to examine the invertebrate G. mellonella as an in vivo infection model for Brucella. Infection assays were employed to validate the fitness of the larval model for Brucella infection and virulence evaluation. The protective efficacy of immune sera was evaluated by pre-incubated with a lethal dose of bacteria before infection. The consistency between the mouse model and the larval model was confirmed by assessing the protective efficacy of two Brucella vaccine strains. The results show that G. mellonella could be infected by Brucella strains, in a dose- and temperature-dependent way. Moreover, this larval model can effectively evaluate the virulence of Brucella strains in a manner consistent with that of mammalian infection models. Importantly, this model can assess the protective efficacy of vaccine immune sera within a day. Further investigation implied that haemolymph played a crucial role in the protective efficacy of immune sera. In conclusion, G. mellonella could serve as a quick, efficient, and reliable model for evaluating the virulence of Brucella strains and efficacy of immune sera in an ethical manner.

Abstract: Bovine brucellosis diagnosis is a major problem to be solved; the disease has a tremendous economic impact with significant losses in meat and dairy products, besides the fact that it can be transmitted to humans. The sanitary measures instituted in Brazil are based on disease control through diagnosis, animal sacrifice, and vaccination. Although the currently available diagnostic tests show suitable quality parameters, they are time-consuming, and the incidence of false-positive and/or false-negative results is still observed, hindering effective disease control. The development of a low-cost, fast, and accurate brucellosis diagnosis test remains a need for proper sanitary measures at a large-scale analysis. In this context, spectroscopy techniques associated with machine learning tools have shown great potential for use in diagnostic tests. In this study, bovine blood serum was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms to build a prediction model for Brucella abortus diagnosis. Here we first pre-treated the UV raw data by using Standard Normal Deviate method to remove baseline deviation, then apply principal component analysis - a clustering method - to observe the group formation tendency; the first results showed no clustering tendency with a messy sample score distribution, then we properly select the main principal components to improve clusterization. Finally, by using machine learning algorithms (SVM and KNN), the predicting models achieved a 92.5% overall accuracy. The present methodology provides a test result in an average time of 5 min, while the standard diagnosis, with the screening and confirmatory tests, can take up to 48 h. The present result demonstrates the method's viability for diagnosing bovine brucellosis, which can significantly contribute to disease control programs in Brazil and other countries.

Title: The emergence of Brucella canis as a public health threat in Europe: what we know and what we need to learn

DOI: 10.1080/22221751.2023.2249126
Abstract: The zoonotic bacteria, Brucella canis, is becoming the leading cause of canine brucellosis in Europe. In dogs, it causes reproductive problems as well as non-specific lameness or discospondilitis. In humans, B. canis can be origin of chronic debilitating conditions characteristic to its genus such as undulant fever, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Although B. canis shows some pathogenic characteristics similar to B. abortus and B. melitensis, it lacks surface O-polysaccharide, like nonzoonotic B. ovis. This review shows that host-B. canis interactions are still poorly understood, with many knowledge and capability gaps, causing relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of existing diagnostic tools. Currently, there is no vaccine for this rough Brucella species. Besides, antimicrobial therapy does not guarantee bacterial elimination, and infection relapses are frequently reported, increasing the risks of antibiotic resistance development. B. canis has been detected in dogs in almost all European countries which increased human exposure, but currently there is no systematic surveillance. Moreover, B. canis caused brucellosis is not included in Animal Health Law, and therefore there is no legal framework to tackle this emerging infectious disease. To map out the diagnostic strategies, identify risks for human infections and propose management scheme for infected pet and kennel dogs, we present current understanding of canine B. canis caused brucellosis, outline major knowledge gaps and propose future steps. To address and highlight challenges veterinary and public health services encounter in Europe, we developed two B. canis infection scenarios: of a single household pet and of a kennel dog in larger group.

Abstract: Brucella RB51 is a live modified vaccine. Its use in water buffalo has been proposed using a vaccination protocol different to that used for cattle, but knowledge of the long-term effects of RB51 vaccination in this species remains incomplete. The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and kinetics of antibody responses in water buffaloes vaccinated according to the protocol described for the bovine species in the WOAH Manual, modified with the use of a triple dose. Water buffaloes were vaccinated with the vaccine RB51. A booster vaccination was administered at 12 months of age. When turning 23-25 months old, female animals were induced to pregnancy. RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination.

Title: Brucellosis and One Health: Inherited and Future Challenges.
Authors: Moriyón Ignacio, Blasco José María, Letesson Jean Jacques, De Massis Fabrizio, Moreno Edgardo
DOI: 10.3390/microorganisms11082070
Abstract: One Health is the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment, a concept that historically owes much to the study of brucellosis, including recent political and ethical considerations. Brucellosis One Health actors include Public Health and Veterinary Services, microbiologists, medical and veterinary practitioners and breeders. Brucellosis awareness, and the correct use of diagnostic, epidemiological and prophylactic tools is essential. In brucellosis, One Health implementation faces inherited and new challenges, some aggravated by global warming and the intensification of breeding to meet growing food demands. In endemic scenarios, disease awareness, stakeholder sensitization/engagement and the need to build breeder trust are unresolved issues, all made difficult by the protean characteristics of this zoonosis. Extended infrastructural weaknesses, often accentuated by geography and climate, are critically important. Capacity-building faces misconceptions derived from an uncritical adoption of control/eradication strategies applied in countries with suitable means, and requires additional reference laboratories in endemic areas. Challenges for One Health implementation include the lack of research in species other than cattle and small ruminants, the need for a safer small ruminant vaccine, the need to fill in the infrastructure gap, the need for realistic capacity-building, the creation of reference laboratories in critical areas, and the stepwise implementation of measures not directly transposed from the so-called developed countries.

Abstract: France has been officially free of bovine brucellosis since 2005. Nevertheless, in 2012, as the source of two human cases, a bovine outbreak due to B. melitensis biovar 3 was confirmed in the French Alpine Bargy massif, due to a spillover from wild, protected Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). In order to reduce high Brucella prevalence in the local ibex population, successive management strategies have been implemented. Lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) was thus identified as a promising on-site screening test, allowing for a rapid diagnosis far from the laboratory. This study compared a commercial LFIA for brucellosis diagnosis with the WOAH-recommended tests for small ruminants (i.e., Rose Bengal test (RBT), Complement fixation test, (CFT) and Indirect ELISA, (iELISA)). LFIA showed the same analytical sensitivity as iELISA on successive dilutions of the International Standard anti-Brucella melitensis Serum (ISaBmS) and the EU Goat Brucella Standard Serum (EUGBSS). Selectivity was estimated at 100% when vaccinated ibex sera were analyzed. When used on samples from naturally infected ibex, LFIA showed high concordance, as well as relative sensitivity and specificity (>97.25%) in comparison with RBT and CFT. This work shows high reliability and ensures a better standardization of LFIA testing for wild ruminants.

Title: Brucellosis detection and the role of Brucella spp. cell wall proteins
Authors: Bulashev Aitbay, Eskendirova Saule
DOI: 10.14202/vetworld.2023.1390-1399
Abstract: Brucellosis remains an endemic zoonotic disease in many developing countries, causing great harm to public health and devastating losses to livestock. One of the main reasons for the low effectiveness of anti-brucellosis measures is the lack of reliable methods for diagnosing infected animals throughout their lifespan. Classical serological tests, such as the tube agglutination test, rose Bengal plate test, and complement fixation test, as well as commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, are based on the detection of antibodies to the cell wall polysaccharide antigens of Brucella spp. smooth strains. As a result, they do not exclude cross-reactions with related bacteria and fail to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. Over the past decades, many attempts have been made to identify immunoreactive and pathogen-specific protein antigens. To date, several studies have investigated Brucella spp. recombinant proteins, including cell wall proteins, as the best antigens for diagnosing brucellosis in animals and humans. However, the available results on the specificity and sensitivity of serological tests based on cell wall proteins are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge of the diagnostic value of outer membrane and/or periplasmic proteins of Brucella spp. The goal is to identify future developments that may lead to reliable antigens for serological tests.

Title: Tropical spastic paraparesis.
Authors: Román Gustavo C
DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-323-98817-9.00026-0
Abstract: A large number of causative agents can result in spinal cord disorders in the tropics including etiologies similar to those of temperate regions such as trauma, spinal bone and disc lesions, tumors, epidural abscess, and congenital malformations. Yet infectious and nutritional disorders differ in their higher prevalence in tropical regions including Pott's disease; brucellosis; neuroborreliosis; various parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, neurocysticercosis, and eosinophilic meningitis. Notably, the retrovirus HTLV-1 is the causeof tropical spastic paraparesis/paraplegia or TSP. Nutritional causes of TSP include vitamin B and folate deficiencies, while endemic clusters of konzo and tropical ataxic myeloneuropathy occur in Africa, along with malnutrition and excessive consumption of cyanide-containing bitter cassava. Other toxic etiologies of TSP include lathyrism and fluorosis. Nutritional forms of myelopathy are associated often with optic and sensory neuropathy, hence the name tropical myeloneuropathies. Acute transverse myelopathy, seen in association with vaccination, infections, and fibrocartilaginous embolism of the nucleus pulposus, can be ubiquitous. Multiple sclerosis and optic myelopathy occur in the tropics but with lesser prevalence than in temperate regions. The advent of modern imaging in the tropics, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, has allowed better diagnosis and treatment of these conditions that are a frequent cause of death and disability. This chapter provides an overview of TSP emphasizing the most common causes with clues to diagnosis and effective therapy.

Abstract: From 2001, due to the launching of the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis, Brazil began a series of studies aimed at the epidemiological characterization of bovine brucellosis in its federative units. In the state of Mato Grosso, studies conducted in 2003 and 2014 showed a reduction in the prevalence of infected herds from 41.2 % to 24 % and in the prevalence of seropositive animals from 10.2 % to 5.1 %. These results stemmed from the efficient heifer vaccination program with S19 implemented by the state. From this scenario, the present study quantified and compared the benefits and costs of bovine brucellosis control in the state through a financial analysis. When considering private and public costs, the Net Present Value (NPV) was estimated at US$ 37.5 million, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was calculated at 31 %, and the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was 2.3. When considering only the private costs, the NPV was US$ 51.3 million, the IRR was 46 % and the BCR was 3.43, indicating that the cattle producer in Mato Grosso had a return of US$ 3.43 for each US$ 1.00 invested. Therefore, the bovine brucellosis control actions carried out in the state of Mato Grosso between 2003 and 2014 were highly advantageous from the economic point of view. The most rational way to continue decreasing bovine brucellosis prevalences at low cost in the state is to maintain the heifer vaccination program, using the RB51 vaccine in addition to S19.

Title: A participatory approach to understand the attitudes and perceptions towards priority endemic cattle diseases among dairy farmers and animal health experts in Henan province, China.

Abstract: The dairy industry is threatened by a variety of endemic diseases and emerging diseases, and various control programs have been initiated in China. The increased application of evidence to policymaking can help improve the efficiency of disease control programs; however, the relevant research literature is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the attitudes and perceptions towards priority endemic diseases among dairy farmers and animal health experts by taking Henan province of China as the example and using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions, respectively. This study involved 24 farmers and 27 animal health experts from December 2019 to January 2021. The diseases considered by farmers to be of significance to their animals are different from those considered priorities by the participating experts and the government list. From the perspective of the individual farmers, the effects of zoonotic disease risks such as bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis appear to be less pronounced than "visible" losses at the farm level, contrary to the opinion of experts. Participating experts believed that poor on-farm biosecurity measures posed challenges to the control and eradication of priority endemic diseases; however, there are gaps in farmers' understanding of biosecurity principles, and low motivations to take such disease prevention measures. Several other challenges to the control and eradication of priority endemic diseases also emerged in the data, including the lack of diagnostic tools applicable in the field as well as differential diagnostic tools to differentiate natural infection from vaccination, lack of effective and commercially available vaccines against single or multiple pathogen(s) or new genotypes/serotypes, weak early warning and information networks and insufficient economic compensation. A holistic understanding of people's perceptions of disease control would facilitate the implementation of inclusive and engaging disease control strategies, thereby increasing the efficiency of disease control.

Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease whose causative agent, Brucella spp., is endemic in many countries of the Mediterranean basin, including Greece. Although the occurrence of brucellosis must be reported to the authorities, it is believed that the disease is under-reported in Greece, and knowledge about the genomic diversity of brucellae is lacking. Methods: Thus, 44 Brucella isolates, primarily B. melitensis, collected between 1999 and 2009 from humans and small ruminants in Greece were subjected to whole genome sequencing using short-read technology. The raw reads and assembled genomes were used for in silico genotyping based on single nucleotide substitutions and alleles. Further, specific genomic regions encoding putative virulence genes were screened for characteristic nucleotide changes, which arose in different genotype lineages. Results: In silico genotyping revealed that the isolates belonged to three of the known sublineages of the East Mediterranean genotype. In addition, a novel subgenotype was identified that was basal to the other East Mediterranean sublineages, comprising two Greek strains. The majority of the isolates can be assumed to be of endemic origin, as they were clustered with strains from the Western Balkans or Turkey, whereas one strain of human origin could be associated with travel to another endemic region, e.g. Portugal. Further, nucleotide substitutions in the housekeeping gene rpoB and virulence-associated genes were detected, which were characteristic of the different subgenotypes. One of the isolates originating from an aborted bovine foetus was identified as B. abortus vaccine strain RB51. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the existence of several distinct persistent Brucella sp. foci in Greece. To detect these and for tracing infection chains, extensive sampling initiatives are required.

Abstract: Brucellosis is an economically devastating animal disease and has public health concern. Serological methods such as Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), Complement Fixation Test (CFT), and Indirect-Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (I-ELISA) have been used to detect brucellosis. However, there is limited comparative evaluation studies and lack of molecular confirmation of the causative agents in the study areas. The study was aimed to compare RBPT, I-ELISA, CFT, and confirmation using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). A total of 2317 sera samples were collected from brucellosis-affected areas of Ethiopia with no vaccination history. All sera were subjected to comparative serological assays. Post-cross tabulation, sensitivity, and specificity were determined using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis software. PCR was performed on 54 seropositive samples using genus- and species-specific primers.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a common zoonosis, which is caused by Brucella infection, and Brucella often infects livestock, leading to abortion and infertility. At present, human brucellosis remains one of the major public health problems in China. According to previous research, most areas in northwest China, including Xinjiang, Tibet, and other regions, are severely affected by Brucella. Although there are vaccines against animal Brucellosis, the effect is often poor. In addition, there is no corresponding vaccine for human Brucellosis infection. Therefore, a new strategy for early prevention and treatment of Brucella is needed. A multi-epitope vaccine should be developed. In this study, we identified the antigenic epitopes of the Brucella type IV secretion system VirB8 and Virb10 using an immunoinformatics approach, and screened out 2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, 9 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, 6 linear B cell epitopes, and 6 conformational B cell epitopes. These advantageous epitopes are spliced together through different linkers to construct a multi-epitope vaccine. The silico tests showed that the multi-epitope vaccine was non-allergenic and had a strong interaction with TLR4 molecular docking. In immune simulation results, the vaccine construct may be useful in helping brucellosis patients to initiate cellular and humoral immunity. Overall, our findings indicated that the multi-epitope vaccine construct has a high-quality structure and suitable characteristics, which may provide a theoretical basis for the development of a Brucella vaccine.

DOI: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.105979
Abstract: In Paraguay, whose main economic activity is cattle raising, bovine brucellosis is an endemic disease. Between May 2019 and October 2020, a national prevalence survey was implemented by the Paraguayan Veterinary Services. In the frame of that survey, a cross-sectional study was conducted in the eastern region of Paraguay to identify the risk factors that could be associated with brucellosis-positive farms and to estimate the bovine brucellosis seroprevalence and farmers' awareness about the disease. A questionnaire was administered to farmers to collect data on potential risk factors for bovine brucellosis as well as awareness on the disease. A logistic regression model was used to identify the risk factors associated with a farm brucellosis positive status. Blood samples were collected from 2551 cattle on 133 farms. The overall apparent seroprevalence was 27.8 % (95 % CI: 20.4-36.3 %) at the farm level, and 5.5 % (95 % CI: 4.7-6.5 %) at the animal level. Among 18 potential risk factors, four were associated with a farm brucellosis positive status. Farm size was associated with a higher risk of positive status in medium (20-80 cows) and large farms (>80 cows), compared with small farms (<20 cows). Barn disinfection had a protective effect on the risk of positive status. Conversely, presence of dogs and not incinerating/burying aborted material increased this risk. Even if 89 % of the farmers acknowledged being aware of the bovine brucellosis transmission to humans, only 46% of these farmers declared using protective gloves during calving or when handling abortions. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of implementing biosecurity measures and proper disposal of aborted material to control the disease. Therefore, to control the disease in Paraguay, vaccination campaigns should be accompanied by awareness campaigns addressing good farm management practices to minimize the risk of introduction and maintenance of brucellosis as well as the risk of human infection.

Title: Characterization of Brucella abortus Mutant A19mut2, a Potential DIVA Vaccine Candidate with a Modification on Lipopolysaccharide
Authors: Abdelgawad Hosny Ahmed, Lian Zhengmin, Yin Yi, Fang Tian, Tian Mingxing, Yu Shengqing
DOI: 10.3390/vaccines11071273
Abstract: Background: Brucella abortus is the main causative agent for bovine brucellosis. B. abortus A19 is a widely used vaccine strain to protect cows from Brucella infection in China. However, A19 has a similar lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen to that of the field virulent Brucella strain, whose immunization interferes with the serodiagnosis of vaccinated and infected animals. [Aim] To develop a novel Brucella DIVA vaccine candidate. Study design and methods: The B. abortus mutant A19mut2 with the formyltransferase gene wbkC is replaced by an acetyltransferase gene wbdR from E. coli O157 using the bacterial homologous recombination technique, generating a modified O-polysaccharide that cannot induce antibodies in mice against wild-type Brucella LPS. The biological phenotypes of the A19mut2 were assessed using a growth curve analysis, agglutination tests, Western blotting, and stress resistance assays. Histopathological changes and bacterial colonization in the spleens of vaccinated mice were investigated to assess the residual virulence and protection of the A19mut2. Humoral and cellular immunity was evaluated by measuring the levels of IgG, IgG subtypes, and the release of cytokines IFN-γ and IL10 in the splenocytes of the vaccinated mice. ELISA coated with wild-type LPS can distinguish mouse antibodies induced by A19 and A19mut2 immunization. Results: The A19mut2 showed a decreased residual virulence in mice, compared to the A19 strain, but induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses, as the A19 immunization did. The protection efficacy of A19mut2 immunization against B. abortus S2308 NalR infection was similar to that of A19 immunization. Conclusion: The A19mut2 has potential as a novel DIVA vaccine candidate in the future.

Abstract: Brucellosis has become a global zoonotic disease, seriously endangering the health of people all over the world. Vaccination is an effective strategy for protection against Brucella infection in livestock in developed countries. However, current vaccines are pathogenic to humans and pregnant animals, which limits their use. Therefore, it is very important to improve the safety and immune protection of Brucella vaccine. In this study, different bioinformatics approaches were carried out to predict the physicochemical properties, T/B epitope, and tertiary structure of Omp2b and Omp31. Then, these two proteins were sequentially linked, and the Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) variable region was fused to the N-terminal of the epitope sequence. In addition, molecular docking was performed to show that the structure of the fusion protein vaccine had strong affinity with B7 (B7-1, B7-2). This study showed that the designed vaccine containing CTLA-4 had high potency against Brucella, which could provide a reference for the future development of efficient brucellosis vaccines.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a chronic disease caused by Brucella species with a wide range of hosts, from marine mammals to terrestrial species, but with strict host preferences. With the zoonotic character, the prevalence of human brucellosis cases is a reflection of animal infections. This study aimed to identify 192 Brucella isolates obtained from various sources by Bruce-ladder PCR and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities by gradient diffusion method (E-test). As a result of the PCR, all human isolates (n = 57) were identified as B. melitensis. While 58 (82.9%) of the cattle isolates were identified as B. abortus, 59 (90.8%) of the sheep isolates were identified as B. melitensis. In addition, 12 (17.1%) of the cattle isolates and 6 (9.2%) of the sheep isolates were determined as B. melitensis and B. abortus, respectively. The primary host change behavior of B. melitensis was 1.9 times higher than that of B. abortus. While gentamicin and ciprofloxacin susceptibilities of Brucella isolates were 100%, tetracycline, doxycycline, streptomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampicin susceptibilities were 99%, 99%, 97.4%, 91.7% and 83.9%, respectively. The lowest sensitivity of the isolates was determined against to cefoperazone as 26%. A triple-drug resistance was detected in 1 B. abortus isolate that included simultaneous resistance to cefoperazone, rifampicin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The high susceptibility profiles we found against to antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, used widely in treatment, are encouraging. However, the change in the canonical Brucella species-primary host preference suggests the need to reconsider eradication program, including updating vaccine formulations.

Title: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-Trained Macrophages Elicit a Protective Inflammatory Response against the Pathogenic Bacteria Brucella abortus.
Authors: de Araujo Ana Carolina V S C, de Queiroz Nina M G P, Marinho Fábio V, Oliveira Sergio C
DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200642
Abstract: The bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) can elicit enhanced innate immune responses against a wide range of infections, known as trained immunity. Brucella abortus is the causative agent of brucellosis, a debilitating disease that affects humans and animals. In this study, we demonstrate that C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages under BCG training enhance inflammatory responses against B. abortus. BCG-trained macrophages showed increased MHC class II and CD40 expression on the cell surface and higher IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1β production. The increase in IL-1β secretion was accompanied by enhanced activation of canonical and noncanonical inflammasome platforms. We observed elevated caspase-11 expression and caspase-1 processing in BCG-trained macrophages in response to B. abortus compared with untrained cells. In addition, these BCG-trained cells showed higher NLRP3 expression after B. abortus infection. From a metabolic point of view, signaling through the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase pathway was also enhanced. In addition, BCG training resulted in higher inducible NO synthase expression and nitrite production, culminating in an improved macrophage-killing capacity against intracellular B. abortus. In vivo, we monitored a significant reduction in the bacterial burden in organs from BCG-trained C57BL/6 mice when compared with the untrained group. In addition, previous BCG immunization of RAG-1-deficient mice partially protects against Brucella infection, suggesting the important role of the innate immune compartment in this scenario. Furthermore, naive recipient mice that received BM transfer from BCG-trained donors showed greater resistance to B. abortus when compared with their untrained counterparts. These results demonstrate that BCG-induced trained immunity in mice results in better control of intracellular B. abortus in vivo and in vitro.

Title: Pathophysiology, Current Therapeutic Options, Vaccine Candidates, and Drug Targets for Human Brucellosis.
Authors: Pritam Manisha, Kumar Rajnish
DOI: 10.2174/1874467217666230713093802
Abstract: Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by different species of Brucella bacteria. It is also known as Malta fever, one of the neglected diseases that can cause infection in both animals and humans. Although human-to-human infection is rare, it can spread through the inhalation of airborne agents, and if left untreated, it can lead to serious health complications. In this review, we aim to highlight the pathophysiology, prevention, epidemiology, mitigation, cure, targets for drug development, and vaccine development against human brucellosis. Human brucellosis is mainly caused by consuming unpasteurized milk or dairy products, uncooked meat, and contact with infected animals. Human brucellosis outbreaks are mainly associated with developing and low- to middle-income countries. Brucella is present all over the world, and only some of the regions are at high risk, including Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Mexico, South and Central America, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East. Because of intracellular survival, inhibition of apoptosis, and immune evasion, Brucella can survive and multiply inside the host cell, which can cause chronic disease. By using proteomics approaches, several new drug targets were reported for human brucellosis that can be used for the development of novel drugs. We can also develop an efficient vaccine against human brucellosis by exploring previously reported vaccine candidates against animal brucellosis. The information provided through this review will facilitate research to control and cure human brucellosis and its complicated symptoms.

Abstract: Over the past 10 years, immunization of cattle in Russia has been performed using vaccines from Brucella abortus strains 82, 19 and 75/79. To prevent brucellosis in small ruminants, two vaccines have been used, from the Brucella melitensis strain REV-1 and the B. abortus strain 19; note that twice as many animals have been immunized with the former vaccine than with the latter vaccine. The disadvantage of using these preparations is the formation of prolonged post-vaccination seropositivity, which is especially pronounced in animals after immunization with vaccines from B. abortus strain 19 and B. melitensis strain REV-1. This study aims to perform the whole genome sequencing of Brucella vaccine strains from the Russian collection. A bioinformatics analysis of the genomic data proved that the vaccine strains 75/79AB, 82, R-1096, and the KV 17/100 belong to ST-2, 104 M to ST-1, KV 13/100 to ST-5. This analysis allowed us to characterize vaccine strains's phylogenetic relationships and to prove the close relation of vaccine strains 75/79AB, 82, R-1096. Also, we defined candidate mutations in genes pmm, wbdA, wbkA, wboA, and eryB, which could be responsible for the attenuated virulence of vaccine strains. The complete genomic sequences of B. abortus strains make further studies of bacterial pathogenicity determinants and virulence phenotype feasible, as well as their use in quality control of animal medicines.

Abstract: Introduction: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution. It is considered endemic in Eritrea, however, the current prevalence status and related risk factors in animals are unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for brucellosis in dairy cattle in Maekel and Debub regions, Eritrea. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted between August 2021 and February 2022. A total of 2,740 dairy cattle from 214 herds in 10 sub-regions of Eritrea were selected for blood and data collection. Blood samples were tested using Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and positive samples were confirmed using competitive (c-ELISA). Data on risk factors was collected using questionnaire and analyzed using logistic regression. Results: In total, 34/2740 animals tested positive by RBPT. Of these, 29 were confirmed positive by c-ELISA, giving an apparent and estimated true individual-level prevalence of 1.1% (95% CI: 0.7, 1.5%) and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.9, 1.8%), respectively. Sixteen herds (7.5%) tested positive by RBPT and of these 15 herds (7.0%) were confirmed positive by c-ELISA, giving an estimated true herd-level prevalence of 7.0% (95% CI: 4.0, 10.7). Animal and herd-level apparent prevalence was 1.6 and 9.2% in Maekel, while in Debub it was 0.6 and 5.5%, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis indicated that non-pregnant lactating cows (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.35; p = 0.042) were more likely to be Brucella sero-positive. History of abortion on the farm (aOR = 5.71; p = 0.026) and larger number of cows in the herd (aOR = 1.14; p < 0.001) were associated with brucellosis sero-positivity in herds. Conclusion: Brucellosis prevalence was low in the study areas. Nonetheless, this low prevalence may increase if the disease is not controlled. Therefore, testing animals before movement, good farming practices, sanitary measures, and an awareness raising program on brucellosis are recommended.

Abstract: Bacteria of the genus Brucella are facultative intracellular parasites that cause brucellosis, a severe animal and human disease. Recently, a group of taxonomists merged the brucellae with the primarily free-living, phylogenetically related Ochrobactrum spp. in the genus Brucella. This change, founded only on global genomic analysis and the fortuitous isolation of some opportunistic Ochrobactrum spp. from medically compromised patients, has been automatically included in culture collections and databases. We argue that clinical and environmental microbiologists should not accept this nomenclature, and we advise against its use because (i) it was presented without in-depth phylogenetic analyses and did not consider alternative taxonomic solutions; (ii) it was launched without the input of experts in brucellosis or Ochrobactrum; (iii) it applies a non-consensus genus concept that disregards taxonomically relevant differences in structure, physiology, population structure, core-pangenome assemblies, genome structure, genomic traits, clinical features, treatment, prevention, diagnosis, genus description rules, and, above all, pathogenicity; and (iv) placing these two bacterial groups in the same genus creates risks for veterinarians, medical doctors, clinical laboratories, health authorities, and legislators who deal with brucellosis, a disease that is particularly relevant in low- and middle-income countries. Based on all this information, we urge microbiologists, bacterial collections, genomic databases, journals, and public health boards to keep the Brucella and Ochrobactrum genera separate to avoid further bewilderment and harm.

DOI: 10.1177/15385744231183786
Abstract: Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonotic infections in the world. Human infections are the result of direct exposure to infected animals or ingestion of unprocessed dairy products. While Brucella sp. infection has largely been eliminated from commercial cattle and swine with aggressive vaccination, there is a significant prevalence of Brucella sp. infection in the expanding population of feral swine in the US. We report the surgical treatment of a ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta due to Brucella suis in a woman living in a rural community with a large population of feral swine. Vascular surgeons should be aware that brucellosis can result in arterial infection and should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with a history of exposure to feral swine or the ingestion of unprocessed dairy products.

Title: Brucella abortus antigen omp25 vaccines: Development and targeting based on Lactococcus lactis.
Authors: Gouran Somaye Tirbakhsh, Doosti Abbas, Jami Mohammad Saeid
DOI: 10.1002/vms3.1173
Abstract: Background: Most Brucella infections take place on mucosal membranes. Therefore, creating vaccinations delivered through the mucosa may be crucial for managing brucellosis. Consequently, we assessed the efficacy of a recombinant oral antigen delivery system based on Lactococcus lactis for Brucella abortus omp25 antigen. Method: Oral vaccinations with L. lactis transformed with pNZ8148 variants encoding for omp25 (pNZ8148:omp25) and free-pNZ8148 were administered to mice. On day 30, following immunization in animal groups, anti-omp25-specific IgG1 antibodies were assessed by the ELISA test. Additionally, nasal and bronchoalveolar lavages containing omp25-specific secretory IgA (sIgA) were analysed by ELISA. ELISA test and real-time PCR were also used to analyse cytokine responses up to 28 days following the last boost. In addition, the protective potential of L. lactis pNZ8148:omp25 vaccines was assessed in BALB/c mice by exposing them to the B. abortus strain. Results: Based on the initial screening results, the omp25 protein was identified for immunogenicity because it had the maximum solubility and flexibility and antigenic values of 0.75. The produced plasmid was digested using KpnI and XbaI. By electrophoretic isolation of the digestion fragments at 786 bp, the omp25 gene, the successful production of the recombinant plasmid, was confirmed. Antigen expression at the protein level revealed that the target group generated the 25 kDa-sized omp25 protein, but there was no protein expression in the control group. Fourteen days after priming, there was a considerable amount of omp25-specific IgG1 in the sera of mice vaccinated with pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis (p < 0.001 in target groups compared to the phosphate-buffered saline control group). IFN-γ and TNF-α levels were more significant in samples from mice that had been given the pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRBA vaccinations, in samples taken on days 14 and 28, respectively (p < 0.001). The pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRBA immunization groups had significantly greater IL-4 and IL-10 transcription levels than the other groups. The spleen portions from the pNZ8148-Usp45-omp25-L. lactis and IRIBA vac group had less extensive spleen injuries, alveolar oedema, lymphocyte infiltration and morphological damage due to the inflammatory process. Conclusion: Our study offers a novel method for using the food-grade, non-pathogenic and noncommercial bacterium L. lactis as a protein cell factory to produce the novel immunogenic fusion candidate romp25. This method offers an appealing new approach to assessing the cost-effective, safe, sustainable, simple pilot development of pharmaceutical products.

Abstract: Bovine brucellosis, mainly caused by Brucella abortus, is a worldwide distribution anthropozoonosis that causes great economic losses. In 2001, Brazil launched the National Program for the Control and Eradication of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT). Contemporaneously, a great effort to characterize the epidemiology of the disease in Brazilian states was started. In the state of Rondônia, a first epidemiological study was carried out in 2004, revealing a prevalence of 35.2% of infected herds and 6.22% of seropositive females. In 2014, after a successful heifer vaccination program with strain 19 (S19), a second study detected a reduction in the prevalence of infected herds to 12.3% and of seropositive females to 1.9%. The present study aimed to quantify and compare the costs and benefits related to the control of bovine brucellosis in the state through an accounting analysis. Vaccinating heifers and performing serological tests to move animals were computed as private costs. The expenditures of the state official veterinary service for brucellosis control were considered public cost. The considered benefits of lowering prevalence were decreased cow replacement, decreased abortions, decreased perinatal and cow mortality, and increased milk production. Considering private and public costs, the net present value (NPV) was estimated at US$ 18.3 million, the internal rate of return (IRR) was calculated at 23%, and the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) was 1.7. When considering only the private costs, the NPV was US$34.9 million, the IRR was 49%, and the BCR was 3.0, meaning that the bovine producer had a return of 3 for each unit of currency invested. The results showed that the bovine brucellosis control measures implemented in the state of Rondônia, which had as its main strategy the vaccination of heifers with S19, produced highly advantageous economic results. The state should continue with its vaccination program, stimulating the use of the RB51 vaccine in addition to S19, to achieve further reductions in prevalence at low cost.

Title: Exosomes released by Brucella-infected macrophages inhibit the intracellular survival of Brucella by promoting the polarization of M1 macrophages.

Abstract: Exosomes, membrane vesicles released extracellularly from cells, contain nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and other components, allowing the transfer of material information between cells. Recent studies reported the role of exosomes in pathogenic microbial infection and host immune mechanisms. Brucella-invasive bodies can survive in host cells for a long time and cause chronic infection, which causes tissue damage. Whether exosomes are involved in host anti-Brucella congenital immune responses has not been reported. Here, we extracted and identified exosomes secreted by Brucella melitensis M5 (Exo-M5)-infected macrophages, and performed in vivo and in vitro studies to examine the effects of exosomes carrying antigen on the polarization of macrophages and immune activation. Exo-M5 promoted the polarization of M1 macrophages, which induced the significant secretion of M1 cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ) through NF-κB signalling pathways and inhibited the secretion of M2 cytokines (IL-10), thereby inhibiting the intracellular survival of Brucella. Exo-M5 activated innate immunity and promoted the release of IgG2a antibodies that protected mice from Brucella infection and reduced the parasitaemia of Brucella in the spleen. Furthermore, Exo-M5 contained Brucella antigen components, including Omp31 and OmpA. These results demonstrated that exosomes have an important role in immune responses against Brucella, which might help elucidate the mechanisms of host immunity against Brucella infection and aid the search for Brucella biomarkers and the development of new vaccine candidates.

Abstract: Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis are the primary etiological agents of brucellosis in large and small ruminants, respectively. There are limited comparative genomic studies involving Brucella strains that explore the relatedness among both species. In this study, we involved strains (n=44) representing standard, vaccine and Indian field origin for pangenome, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phylogenetic analysis. Both species shared a common gene pool representing 2884 genes out of a total 3244 genes. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis indicated higher SNP diversity among B. melitensis (3824) strains in comparison to B. abortus (540) strains, and a clear demarcation was identified between standard/vaccine and field strains. The analysis for virulence genes revealed that virB3, virB7, ricA, virB5, ipx5, wbkC, wbkB, and acpXL genes were highly conserved in most of the Brucella strains. Interestingly, virB10 gene was found to have high variability among the B. abortus strains. The cgMLST analysis revealed distinct sequence types for the standard/vaccine and field strains. B. abortus strains from north-eastern India fall within similar sequence type differing from other strains. In conclusion, the analysis revealed a highly shared core genome among two Brucella species. SNP analysis revealed B. melitensis strains exhibit high diversity as compared to B. abortus strains. Strains with absence or high polymorphism of virulence genes can be exploited for the development of novel vaccine candidates effective against both B. abortus and B. melitensis.

Abstract: Chickenpox is an old but easily neglected infectious disease. Although chickenpox is preventable by vaccines, vaccine breakthroughs often occur, and the chickenpox epidemic is on the rise. Chickenpox is not included in the list of regulated communicable diseases that must be reported and controlled by public and health departments; therefore, it is crucial to rapidly identify and report varicella outbreaks during the early stages. The Baidu index (BDI) can supplement the traditional surveillance system for infectious diseases, such as brucellosis and dengue, in China. The number of reported chickenpox cases and internet search data also showed a similar trend. BDI can be a useful tool to display the outbreak of infectious diseases.

Abstract: Background: Table olives are becoming well recognized as a source of probiotic bacteria that might be used to create a health-promoting fermented food product by traditional procedures based on the activities of indigenous microbial consortia present in local environments. Methodology. In the present study, the characterization of probiotic bacteria isolated from mince, chunks, and brine of fermented green and black olives (Olea europaea) was done based on morphological, biochemical, and physiological characteristics. Results: Bacterial isolates demonstrated excellent survival abilities at 25, 37, and 45°C and at a variable range of pH. However, the optimum temperature is 37 and the optimum pH is 7 for all three isolates. An antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was found among these isolates through the disc diffusion method. Most of the isolates were susceptible to streptomycin, imipenem, and chloramphenicol, whereas, amoxicillin showed resistance to these isolates, and variable results were recorded for the rest of the antibiotics tested. The growth of the isolates was optimum with the supplementation of 3% NaCl and 0.3% bile salt. The isolated bacteria were able to ferment skimmed milk into yogurt, hence making it capable of producing organic acid. Conclusion: Isolates of Lactobacillus crispatus MB417, Lactococcus lactis MB418 from black olives, and Carnobacterium divergens MB421 from green olives were characterized as potential candidates for use as starter cultures to induce fermentation of other probiotic food products.

Abstract: Brucellosis remains one of the most worldwide distributed zoonosis inflicting serious economical and human health problems in many areas of the world. The disease is caused by different species of the genus Brucella that have different tropisms towards different mammals being the most relevant for human health Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis and Brucella suis that infect cows, goats/sheep, and swine respectively. For B. melitensis, considered the species with more zoonotic potential and highly aggressive for animals, only one vaccine is available to date in the market: Rev 1. This attenuated strain has the disadvantage that is has a very high residual virulence for animals and humans and, for this reason, it is applied by ocular instillation which is technically challenging in many productive settings. For this reason, the search for new vaccines for caprine and ovine brucellosis is an active topic of research. We describe here the construction of a novel highly attenuated vaccine strain (Bm Delta-pgm) that confers excellent levels of protection against B. melitensis in the mouse model of infection. This strain is a clean deletion of the phosphoglucomutase (pgm) gene that codes for a protein that catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-P to glucose-1-P, which is used as a precursor for the biosynthesis of many polysaccharides, including the O-antigen of the lipopolysaccharide and cyclic beta glucans. Our results indicate that vaccination with Bm Delta-pgm induces a robust memory cellular immune response but no antibody production against the O-antigen. Cross protection experiments show that this new vaccine protects against B. abortus and B. suis raising the possibility that Bm Delta-pgm could be used as a universal vaccine for the most important Brucella species.

DOI: 10.1186/s12879-023-08270-4
Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is a chronic zoonotic disease, and Ningxia is one of the high prevalence regions in China. To mitigate the spread of brucellosis, the government of Ningxia has implemented a comprehensive prevention and control plan (2022-2024). It is meaningful to quantitatively evaluate the accessibility of this strategy.Methods: Based on the transmission characteristics of brucellosis in Ningxia, we propose a dynamical model of sheep-human-environment, which coupling with the stage structure of sheep and indirect environmental transmission. We first calculate the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and use the model to fit the data of human brucellosis. Then, three widely applied control strategies of brucellosis in Ningxia, that is, slaughtering of sicked sheep, health education to high risk practitioners, and immunization of adult sheep, are evaluated.Results: The basic reproduction number is calculated as [Formula: see text], indicating that human brucellosis will persist. The model has a good alignment with the human brucellosis data. The quantitative accessibility evaluation results show that current brucellosis control strategy may not reach the goal on time. "Ningxia Brucellosis Prevention and Control Special Three-Year Action Implementation Plan (2022-2024)" will be achieved in 2024 when increasing slaughtering rate [Formula: see text] by 30[Formula: see text], increasing health education to reduce [Formula: see text] to 50[Formula: see text], and an increase of immunization rate of adult sheep [Formula: see text] by 40[Formula: see text]. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the comprehensive control measures are the most effective for brucellosis control, and it is necessary to further strengthen the multi-sectoral joint mechanism and adopt integrated measures to prevention and control brucellosis. These results can provide a reliable quantitative basis for further optimizing the prevention and control strategy of brucellosis in Ningxia.

Abstract: Importance: The protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines FINLAY-FR-2 (Soberana 02) and FINLAY-FR-1A (Soberana Plus) showed good safety and immunogenicity in phase 1 and 2 trials, but the clinical efficacy of the vaccine remains unknown.Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2-dose regimen of FINLAY-FR-2 (cohort 1) and a 3-dose regimen of FINLAY-FR-2 with FINLAY-FR-1A (cohort 2) in Iranian adults.Design, setting, and participants: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 6 cities in cohort 1 and 2 cities in cohort 2. Participants included individuals aged 18 to 80 years without uncontrolled comorbidities, coagulation disorders, pregnancy or breastfeeding, recent immunoglobulin or immunosuppressive therapy, and clinical presentation or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 on enrollment. The study was conducted from April 26 to September 25, 2021. Interventions: In cohort 1, 2 doses of FINLAY-FR-2 (n = 13 857) or placebo (n = 3462) were administered 28 days apart. In cohort 2, 2 doses of FINLAY-FR-2 plus 1 dose of FINLAY-FR-1A (n = 4340) or 3 placebo doses (n = 1081) were administered 28 days apart. Vaccinations were administered via intramuscular injection. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was polymerase chain reaction-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 infection at least 14 days after vaccination completion. Other outcomes were adverse events and severe COVID-19. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
Results: In cohort 1 a total 17 319 individuals received 2 doses and in cohort 2 5521 received 3 doses of the vaccine or placebo. Cohort 1 comprised 60.1% men in the vaccine group and 59.1% men in the placebo group; cohort 2 included 59.8% men in the vaccine group and 59.9% in the placebo group. The mean (SD) age was 39.3 (11.9) years in cohort 1 and 39.7 (12.0) years in cohort 2, with no significant difference between the vaccine and placebo groups. The median follow-up time in cohort 1 was 100 (IQR, 96-106) days and, in cohort 2, 142 (137-148) days. In cohort 1, 461 (3.2%) cases of COVID-19 occurred in the vaccine group and 221 (6.1%) in the placebo group (vaccine efficacy: 49.7%; 95% CI, 40.8%-57.3%) vs 75 (1.6%) and 51 (4.3%) in cohort 2 (vaccine efficacy: 64.9%; 95% CI, 49.7%-59.5%). The incidence of serious adverse events was lower than 0.1%, with no vaccine-related deaths. Conclusions and relevance: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of the efficacy and safety of FINLAY-FR-2 and FINLAY-FR-1A, 2 doses of FINLAY-FR-2 plus the third dose of FINLAY-FR-1A showed acceptable vaccine efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 as well as COVID-19-related severe infections. Vaccination was generally safe and well tolerated. Therefore, Soberana may have utility as an option for mass vaccination of the population, especially in resource-limited settings, because of its storage condition and affordable price.

Abstract: Brucellosis in cattle herds has caused severe economic losses in many regions worldwide. A cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the presence of Brucella spp. in industrial dairy cattle farms in Iran. For this purpose, 935 blood and 935 milk samples were randomly collected from industrial dairy cattle farms in Iran's Alborz and Tehran provinces. Blood and milk samples were collected on the same day from each cow. Serological, bacteriological, and molecular characterization of Brucella isolates were performed using standard methods. Our results revealed the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle farms in the Alborz and Tehran provinces, reaching 19.8%, 6.7%, 5.1%, 14.1%, and 13.1% using the Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT), serum agglutination test (SAT), 2-mercaptoethanol test (2-ME), indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) and milk ring test (MRT), respectively. Furthermore, the results of bacterial culture and PCR analyses showed the presence of Brucella abortus among dairy cattle in the Alborz province and Brucella melitensis and B. abortus among dairy cattle in the Tehran province. Moreover, statistical analysis with Cohen's Kappa has highlighted the near-perfect agreement between RBPT and i-ELISA (k = 0.86). In contrast, substantial agreement was shown between RBPT and SAT performance (k = 0.70) and moderate agreement between RBPT and 2-ME (k = 0.67). The findings of this investigation showed shedding of Brucella in the milk of seropositive cows, which is a serious problem involving the maintenance and further spread of Brucella infection on the farm. Therefore, for brucellosis detection or eradication in dairy cattle farms, bacteriological and serological tests of milk samples should be performed along with blood analysis to inhibit the uncontrolled spread of the disease in animals and humans.

Title: The quantity and quality of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies show contrariwise association with COVID-19 severity: lessons learned from IgG avidity.

Abstract: Gaining more appreciation on the protective/damaging aspects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity associated with disease severity is of great importance. This study aimed to evaluate the avidity of serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) in hospitalized symptomatic COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 carriers as well as to compare antibody avidities with respect to vaccination status, vaccination dose and reinfection status. Serum levels of anti-S and anti-N IgG were determined using specific ELISA kits. Antibody avidity was determined by urea dissociation assay and expressed as avidity index (AI) value. Despite higher IgG levels in the symptomatic group, AI values of both anti-S and anti-N IgG were significantly lower in this group compared to asymptomatic individuals. In both groups, anti-S AI values were elevated in one-dose and two-dose vaccinees versus unvaccinated subjects, although significant differences were only detected in the symptomatic group. However, anti-N avidity showed no significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups. Almost all vaccinated patients of different subgroups (based on vaccine type) had higher anti-S IgG avidity, while the statistical significance was detected only between those receiving Sinopharm compared to the unvaccinated subgroup. Also, statistically significant differences in antibody AIs were only found between primarily infected individuals of the two groups. Our findings indicate a key role for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG avidity in protection from symptomatic COVID-19 and calls for the incorporation of antibody avidity measurement into the current diagnostic tests to predict effective immunity toward SARS-CoV-2 infection or even for prognostic purposes.

Title: LDH as an adjuvant makes Brucella outer-membrane vesicles and outer-membrane vesicle-associated proteins highly protective in mice
Authors: Deng Xiaoyu, He Jinke, Xu Jinfeng, Wang Yueli, Yi Jihai, Zhang Huan, Wang Yong, Wang Zhen, Chen Chuangfu
DOI: 10.22038/IJBMS.2023.67394.14775
Abstract: Objectives: Existing Brucella vaccines are attenuated and can cause vaccine-associated brucellosis; and these safety concerns have affected their application. Although subunit vaccines have the advantages of safety, efficacy, low cost, and rapid production, they are usually poorly immunogenic and insufficient to trigger persistent immunity. Therefore, we added layered double hydroxide (LDH) as an adjuvant to Brucella subunit vaccine formulations to enhance the immune response to the antigen. Materials and methods: LDH and Freund's adjuvant were combined with Brucella outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) and OMV-associated proteins to form a subunit vaccine, respectively. The immunogenicity of LDH as an adjuvant was assessed in BALB/c mice. We examined levels of immunoglobulin G, G1, and G2a (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) antibodies (aBs); percentages of Cluster of Differentiation 4-positive (CD4+) and CD8+ T cells in peripheral-blood lymphocytes; and secretion of cytokines in mouse spleen lymphocytes. Finally, splenic index and splenic bacterial load were assessed via Brucella challenge experiments on mice. Results: The LDH subunit vaccine also produced high levels of specific aBs in mice compared with Freund's adjuvant subunit vaccine and induced mainly T-helper 1 cell (Th1)-type immune responses. In addition, mice in the LDH subunit vaccine group had significantly lower bacterial loads in their spleens than those in the Freund's adjuvant subunit vaccine group, and the LDH-OMV vaccine offered a higher level of protection against Brucella attack. Conclusion: LDH as an adjuvant-paired vaccine provided a high level of protection against Brucella infection.

Title: A Single Nasal Dose Vaccination with a Brucella abortus Mutant Potently Protects against Pulmonary Infection.
Authors: Wang Hongbin, Clapp Beata, Hoffman Carol, Yang Xinghong, Pascual David W
DOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.2300071
Abstract: The Brucella abortus double-mutant (ΔznuA ΔnorD Brucella abortus-lacZ [znBAZ]) was assessed for its protective efficacy after vaccination with a single nasal dose. Superior protection was achieved in znBAZ-vaccinated mice against pulmonary, wild-type B. abortus 2308 challenge when compared with conventional livestock Brucella abortus vaccines, the smooth S19 (smooth B. abortus strain 19 vaccine) and rough RB51 (rough mutant vaccine strain of B. abortus) strains. Nasal znBAZ vaccination reduced splenic and lung colonization by wild-type brucellae by >3-4 logs. In contrast, S19 reduced lung colonization by only 32-fold, and RB51 failed to reduce colonization. One profound attribute of znBAZ vaccination was the >3-fold increase in pulmonary CD8+ T cells when compared with other vaccinated groups. S19 vaccination increased only CD4+ T cells. All vaccines induced IFN-γ and TNF-α production by CD4+ T cells, but only znBAZ vaccination enhanced the recruitment of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells, by >100-fold. IL-17 by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also induced by subsequent znBAZ vaccination. These results demonstrate that, in addition to achieving protective immunity by CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, specifically resident memory T cells, also confer protection against brucellosis. The protection obtained by znBAZ vaccination was attributed to IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells, because depletion of CD8+ T cells throughout vaccination and challenge phases abrogated protection. The stimulation of only CD4+ T cells by RB51- and S19-vaccinated mice proved insufficient in protecting against pulmonary B. abortus 2308 challenge. Thus, nasal znBAZ vaccination offers an alternative means to elicit protection against brucellosis.

Abstract: Brucella abortus is the main causative agent of brucellosis in cattle, leading to severe economic consequences in agriculture and affecting public health. The zoonotic nature of the infection increases the need to control the spread and dynamics of outbreaks in animals with the incorporation of high resolution genotyping techniques. Based on such methods, B. abortus is currently divided into three clades, A, B, and C. The latter includes subclades C1 and C2. This study presents the results of whole-genome sequencing of 49 B. abortus strains isolated in Kazakhstan between 1947 and 2015 and of 36 B. abortus strains of various geographic origins isolated from 1940 to 2004. In silico Multiple Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) allowed to assign strains from Kazakhstan to subclades C1 and to a much lower extend C2. Whole-genome Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (wgSNP) analysis of the 46 strains of subclade C1 with strains of worldwide origins showed clustering with strains from neighboring countries, mostly North Caucasia, Western Russia, but also Siberia, China, and Mongolia. One of the three Kazakhstan strains assigned to subclade C2 matched the B. abortus S19 vaccine strain used in cattle, the other two were genetically close to the 104 M vaccine strain. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis dated the introduction of B. abortus subclade C1 into Kazakhstan to the 19th and early 20th centuries. We discuss this observation in view of the history of population migrations from Russia to the Kazakhstan steppes.

Abstract: In Cambodia, goat production and meat consumption are customary among Muslim communities. Recently, goat meat has gained popularity among Cambodians. Goat farmers use a traditional management system, including grazing, requiring minimal labour. The close proximity between humans and animals could increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. A serological survey was undertaken to estimate the prevalence of some priority zoonoses and high-impact animal diseases in the Cambodian goat population. A total of 540 samples were collected from goats in six provinces and analysed with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Brucella species, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), Foot and Mouth Disease virus non-structural protein (FMDV NSP) and Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV). True seroprevalences with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI), taking into account imperfect tests, risk factors and odds ratios (ORs), were calculated to better understand the disease distribution and epidemiology. Independent variables used in statistical modellings included sex, body condition score, age, vaccination history, province and commune, while dependent variables were ELISA test results. The overall true prevalence of antibodies to Brucella spp., C. burnetii, FMDV and PPRV, were 0.1% (95% CI 0.0, 1.0), 7.2% (95% CI 5.3, 9.7), 57.7% (95% CI 53.1, 62.3) and 0.0% (95% CI 0.0, 0.0), respectively. There was no identified risk factor for brucellosis and PPR. The two risk factors for C. burnetii seropositivity were sex (p-value = 0.0005) and commune (p-value <0.0001). However, only the OR of C. burnetii seropositive female goat was significant at 9.7 (95% CI 2.7, 35.5) times higher than male. The risk factors of FMD NSP seropositivity were age (p-value = 0.001) and commune (p-value <0.0001). Only the age 'more than two-year-old' group with a significant OR of 6.2 (95% CI 2.1, 18.4) using the 'up to one-year-old' group as the reference. In summary, Brucella spp. seroprevalence was low, while no evidence of PPRV antibodies was detected in the goat populations. C. burnetii seroprevalence in female goats was significantly higher than for males, and there were significant differences in C. burnetii seroprevalence between communes. The overall FMDV NSP seroprevalence was high, especially in older animals. Vaccination should be advocated to protect animals from FMDV and improve productivity. As the impacts of these zoonoses on human and animal health were still unknown, further investigation of these zoonotic diseases' epidemiology is recommended.

Title: Original and introduced lineages co-driving the persistence of Brucella abortus circulating in West Africa

DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2023.1106361
Abstract: Introduction: Brucellosis, a serious public health issue affecting animals and humans, is neglected in West Africa (WA).Methods: In the present study, bio-typing, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and whole genome sequencing single-nucleotide polymorphism (WGS-SNP) analysis were used to characterize the Brucella abortus (B. abortus) strains from WA. Results: All of the 309 strains analyzed in this study were extracted and downloaded from the international MLVA bank and were from 10 hosts (cattle, humans, ovine, buffalo, dromedaries, horse, sheep, zebu, dog, and cat) distributed in 17 countries in WA. Based on the bio-typing, three biovars, dominated by B. abortus bv.3, were observed and reported across seven decades (1958-2019). With MLST, 129 B. abortus strains from the present study were sorted into 14 STs, with ST34 as the predicted founder. These 14 STs clustered into the global MLST data into three clone complexes (C I-C III) with the majority of strains clustering in C I, while C II forms an independent branch, and C III harbors three STs shared by different continents. These data revealed that most cases were caused by strains from native lineages. According to the MLVA-11 comparison, 309 strains were divided into 22 MLVA-11 genotypes, 15 of which were unique to WA and the remaining seven had a global distribution. MLVA-16 analysis showed that there were no epidemiological links among these strains. Based on the MLVA data, B. abortus strains from WA have high genetic diversity, and predominated genotypes were descended from a native lineage. While the MLVA-16 globally highlights that the dominant native and few introduced lineages (from Brazil, the USA, South Korea, Argentina, India, Italy, Portugal, the UK, Costa Rica, and China) co-driving the B. abortus ongoing prevalence in WA. The high-resolution SNP analysis implied the existence of introduced B. abortus lineages, which may be reasonably explained by the movement and trade of dominant hosts (cattle) and/or their products. Discussion: Our results indicated that B. abortus strains in WA consist of native and introduced strains that necessitate control such as vaccination, testing, slaughtering, and movement control by the relevant country authorities to reduce brucellosis in livestock.

Abstract: Brucella abortus S19 vaccine is a stable attenuated smooth strain, globally used as calfhood vaccine for the prevention of bovine brucellosis. Various agencies demonstrated different doses for vaccinating cattle and buffalo calves leading to ambiguity in selecting a suitable immune vaccine dose. The current study aimed at evaluating four graded doses of S19 vaccine to arrive at the dose which could produce comparable effectiveness as that of full dose prescribed by Indian Pharmacopeia among the Indian calves. Four vaccine doses of which the first dose consisted of full dose (40 × 109 CFU/dose) and the other three were 1/10th, 1/20th, 1/100th reduced doses along with control were tested. Each vaccine dose was administered to 13 cattle calves of 4-5 months of age maintained in separate groups. The blood samples were collected on 0 to 240 days post-vaccination (DPV) at the intervals of 0, 14, 28, 45, 60, 90, 150, 180 and 240 for assessment of vaccine-induced innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The sero-conversion of all vaccinated animals on DPV 45 and persistence of antibody till DPV 240 were noticed. No significant differences were observed in antibody response between animal groups that received full and 1/10th reduced doses. Innate and cell-mediated response by IL-6, TNF-α¸ IFN-γ, CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts showed dose-dependent responses with no significant difference between full dose and 1/10th reduced doses. The results suggest a possible one log reduction of full dose without compromising immune responses to aid larger vaccination coverage for creating herd immunity.

Title: An Epidemiological Study of Brucellosis in Different Animal Species from the Al-Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia.
Authors: Almuzaini Abdulaziz M
DOI: 10.3390/vaccines11030694
Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial illness that affects humans and a variety of domestic animals, especially ruminants. It is mostly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated drinks, foods, undercooked meat, or unpasteurized milk or contact with infected animals. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in camels, sheep, and goat herds in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, using commonly used diagnostic serological procedures such as the Rose Bengal test (RBT), complement fixation test (CFT), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence of brucellosis in camels, sheep, and goats was determined in the selected areas using a cross-sectional study design and a total of 690 farm animals of both sexes of different ages from the three animal species (274 camels, 227 sheep, and 189 goats). According to RBT results, 65 sera were positive for brucellosis, including 15 (5.47%) for camels, 32 (14.09%) for sheep, and 18 (9.50%) for goats. CFT and c-ELISA were performed as confirmatory tests on positive samples resulting from RBT. With c-ELISA, 60 serum samples were confirmed positive, in 14 (5.10%), 30 (13.21%), and 16 (8.46%) camels, sheep, and goats, respectively. There were 59 serum samples confirmed as positive for CFT, including 14 (5.11%), 29 (12.77%), and 16 (8.46%) for camels, sheep, and goats, respectively. Overall, the highest seroprevalence of brucellosis was found in sheep while the least was found in camels from the three tests (RBT, c-ELISA, and CFT). The highest seroprevalence of brucellosis was found in sheep while the least seroprevalence was found in camels. There was also a higher seroprevalence of brucellosis among female animals than males as well as among old animals than young animals. The study, thus, demonstrates brucellosis seroprevalence among farm animals (camels, sheep, and goats) and the significance of intervention measures against brucellosis incidence in both humans and animals through the creation of public awareness and other relevant policy measures such as livestock vaccination, effective hygiene management, and adequate quarantine or serological analysis for newly introduced animals.

Abstract: Brucellosis is considered one of the most serious zoonotic diseases worldwide. This disease affects both human and animal health, in addition to being one of the most widespread zoonotic illnesses in the Middle East and Northern Africa. Human brucellosis generally presents in a diverse and non-specific manner, making laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis critical to the patient's recovery. A coordinated strategy for diagnosing and controlling brucellosis throughout the Middle East is required, as this disease cannot be known to occur without reliable microbiological, molecular, and epidemiological evidence. Consequently, the current review focuses on the current and emerging microbiological diagnostic tools for the early detection and control of human brucellosis. Laboratory assays such as culturing, serology, and molecular analysis can frequently be used to diagnose brucellosis. Although serological markers and nucleic acid amplification techniques are extremely sensitive, and extensive experience has been gained with these techniques in the laboratory diagnosis of brucellosis, a culture is still considered to be the "gold standard" due to the importance of this aspect of public health and clinical care. In endemic regions, however, serological tests remain the primary method of diagnosis due to their low cost, user-friendliness, and strong ability to provide a negative prediction, so they are commonly used. A nucleic acid amplification assay, which is highly sensitive, specific, and safe, is capable of enabling rapid disease diagnosis. Patients who have reportedly fully healed may continue to have positive molecular test results for a long time. Therefore, cultures and serological methods will continue to be the main tools for diagnosing and following up on human brucellosis for as long as no commercial tests or studies demonstrate adequate interlaboratory reproducibility. As there is no approved vaccine that prevents human brucellosis, vaccination-based control of animal brucellosis has become an important part of the management of human brucellosis. Over the past few decades, several studies have been conducted to develop Brucella vaccines, but the problem of controlling brucellosis in both humans and animals remains challenging. Therefore, this review also aims to present an updated overview of the different types of brucellosis vaccines that are currently available.

Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease that causes significant negative impacts on the animal industry and affects over half a million people worldwide every year. The limited safety and efficacy of current animal brucellosis vaccines, combined with the lack of a licensed human brucellosis vaccine, have led researchers to search for new vaccine strategies to combat the disease. To this end, the present research aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a green vaccine candidate that combines Brucella abortus S19 smooth lipopolysaccharide (sLPS) with Quillaja saponin (QS) or QS-Xyloglucan mix (QS-X) against mucosal brucellosis in BALB/C mice. The results of the study indicate that administering two doses of either sLPS-QS or sLPS-QS-X was safe for the animals, triggered a robust immune response, and enhanced protection following intranasal challenge with S19. Specifically, the vaccine combinations led to the secretion of IgA and IgG1 in the BALF of the immunized mice. We also found a mixed IgG1/IgG2a systemic response indicating evidence of both Th1 and Th2 activation, with a predominance of the IgG1 over the IgG2a. These candidates resulted in significant reductions in the bioburden of lung, liver, and spleen tissue compared to the PBS control group. The sLPS-QS vaccination had conferred the greatest protection, with a 130-fold reduction in Brucella burdens in lung and a 55.74-fold reduction in the spleen compared to PBS controls. Vaccination with sLPS-QS-X resulted in the highest reduction in splenic Brucella loads, with a 364.6-fold decrease in bacterial titer compared to non-vaccinated animals. The study suggests that the tested vaccine candidates are safe and effective in increasing the animals' ability to respond to brucellosis via mucosal challenge. It also supports the use of the S19 challenge strain as a safe and cost-effective method for testing Brucella vaccine candidates under BSL-2 containment conditions.

DOI: 10.3390/ani13060962
Abstract: The Barki sheep industry is becoming increasingly important in Egypt because of the high quality of their meat and wool. This sheep breed is also commonly known for its resistance to arid and harsh environmental conditions. Such characteristics can be exploited in solving the problematic situation of inadequate animal protein for human consumption, particularly under climatic changes. However, very few studies have investigated aspects of breeding, nutrition, and susceptibility to infectious or non-infectious diseases in Barki sheep. Herein, we propose to unravel the differences in the clinical and biochemical profiles among Barki sheep of different growth rates. We measured clinical and biochemical parameters in stunted (n = 10; test group) and in good body condition (n = 9; control group) Barki sheep. Animals subjected to this experiment were of the same sex (female), age (12 months old), and housed in the same farm with similar conditions of feeding, management practice, and vaccination and deworming regimens. Regarding clinical examination, stunted/tested sheep showed a significantly higher pulse and respiratory rate compared to sheep with a good body condition/control group. The appetite, body temperature, and digestion processes were the same in both groups. In biochemical investigations, nutritional biomarkers were reduced markedly in stunted sheep compared with the control sheep, including total protein (p = 0.0445), albumin (p = 0.0087), cholesterol (p = 0.0007), and triglycerides (p = 0.0059). In addition, the Barki sheep test group suffered from higher levels of urea and blood urea nitrogen than the control group. Consistently, growth and thyroid hormone levels were lower in stunted sheep than the control sheep, although the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). No significant differences were detected in both groups for serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and zinc (p > 0.05). To detect the reasons for emaciation, certain debilitating infections were tested. All tested sheep showed negative coprological tests for gastrointestinal parasites, and had no obvious seropositivity to brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, or Q fever. This study demonstrates the useful biochemical markers for monitoring growth performance in Egyptian Barki sheep and unravels the usefulness of this breed in nationwide breeding and farming.

DOI: 10.1007/s12033-023-00698-y
Abstract: Brucellosis is one of the neglected endemic zoonoses in the world. Vaccination appears to be a promising health strategy to prevent it. This study used advanced computational techniques to develop a potent multi-epitope vaccine for human brucellosis. Seven epitopes from four main brucella species that infect humans were selected. They had significant potential to induce cellular and humoral responses. They showed high antigenic ability without the allergenic characteristic. In order to improve its immunogenicity, suitable adjuvants were also added to the structure of the vaccine. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine were evaluated. Then its two and three-dimensional structure was predicted. The vaccine was docked with toll-like receptor4 to assess its ability to stimulate innate immune responses. For successful expression of the vaccine protein in Escherichia coli, in silico cloning, codon optimization, and mRNA stability were evaluated. The immune simulation was performed to reveal the immune response profile of the vaccine after injection. The designed vaccine showed the high ability to induce immune response, especially cellular responses to human brucellosis. It showed the appropriate physicochemical properties, a high-quality structure, and a high potential for expression in a prokaryotic system.

Title: Oral vaccination with novel Lactococcus lactis mucosal live vector-secreting Brucella lumazine synthase (BLS) protein induces humoral and cellular immune protection against Brucella abortus.
Authors: Fatehi Zahra, Doosti Abbas, Jami Mohammad Saeid
DOI: 10.1007/s00203-023-03471-6
Abstract: This work aimed to provide recombinant Lactococcus lactis as a potential live vector for the manufacture of recombinant Brucella abortus (rBLS-Usp45). The sequences of the genes were collected from the GenBank database. Using Vaxijen and ccSOL, the proteins' immunogenicity and solubility were evaluated. Mice were given oral vaccinations with recombinant L. lactis. Anti-BLS-specific IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA assay. Cytokine reactions were examined using real-time PCR and the ELISA technique. The BLS protein was chosen for immunogenicity based on the vaccinology screening findings since it had maximum solubility and antigenic values ​​of 99% and 0.75, respectively. The BLS gene, digested at 477 bp, was electrophoretically isolated to demonstrate that the recombinant plasmid was successfully produced. Protein-level antigen expression showed that the target group produced the 18 kDa-sized BLS protein, whereas the control group did not express any proteins. In the sera of mice given the L. lactis-pNZ8148-BLS-Usp45 vaccine 14 days after priming, there was a significant level of BLS-specific IgG1, IgG2a (P < 0.001) compared to the PBS control group. Vaccinated mice showed higher levels of IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-4, and IL-10 in samples obtained on days 14 and 28, after receiving the L. lactis-pNZ8148-BLS-Usp45 and IRBA vaccines (P < 0.001). The inflammatory reaction caused less severe spleen injuries, alveolar edema, lymphocyte infiltration, and morphological damage in the target group's spleen sections. Based on our findings, an oral or subunit-based vaccine against brucellosis might be developed using L. lactis-pNZ8148-BLS-Usp45 as a novel, promising, and safe alternative to the live attenuated vaccines now available.

DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000033182
Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella. There is no effective vaccine against human brucellosis. Omp19 and Omp25 are the outer membrane proteins of Brucella. They are widely expressed and highly conserved in Brucella and have high immunogenicity. Herein, we aim to identify multi-epitope vaccine candidates based on Omp19 and Omp25. We analyzed the physicochemical properties and protein structure of Omp19 and Omp25, and predicted the corresponding B cell and T cell epitopes using bioinformatics analysis. Omp19 and Omp25 were composed of 177 amino acids and 213 amino acids, respectively. They were both stable hydrophilic proteins. The instability indices were 44.8 and 23, respectively. The hydrophilicity was -0.1 and -0.317, respectively. In the secondary structure of Omp19 and Omp25 proteins, the α-helix accounted for 12.43% and 23.94%, the β-sheet was 18.64% and 23.47%, the β-turn was 6.78% and 4.23%, and the random coil was 62.15% and 48.36%. Finally, 5 B cell epitopes, 3 Th-cell epitopes and 5 CTL cell epitopes of Omp19 protein, and 4 B cell epitopes, 3 Th-cell epitopes, and 5 CTL cell epitopes of Omp25 protein were selected as vaccine candidates. In conclusion, we obtained potential B cell and T cell epitopes of the Brucella outer membrane Omp19 and Omp25 proteins. This lays the foundation for the further design of multi-epitope vaccine of Brucella.

Title: Novel multi-epitope vaccine against bovine brucellosis: approach from immunoinformatics to expression.
Authors: Rahimnahal Somayyeh, Yousefizadeh Shahnaz, Mohammadi Yahya
DOI: 10.1080/07391102.2023.2188962
Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonotic caused by the Brucella which is a well-known infectious disease agent in domestic animals and if transmitted, it can cause infection in humans. Because brucellosis is contagious, its control depends on the eradication of the animal disease in farms. There are two vaccines based on the killed and/or weakened bacteria against B. melitensis and B. abortus, but no recombinant vaccine is available for preventing the disease. The present study was designed to develop a multi-epitope vaccine against of B. melitensis and B. abortus using virB10, Omp31 and Omp16 antigens by the prediction of T lymphocytes, T cell cytotoxicity and IFN-γ epitopes. 50S L7/L12 Ribosomal protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used as a bovine TLR4 and TLR9 agonist. GPGPG, AAY and KK linkers were used as a linker. Brucella construct was well-integrated in the pET-32a Shuttle vector with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The final construct contained 769 amino acids, that it was soluble protein of about ∼82 kDa after expression in the Escherichia coli SHuffle host. Modeled protein analysis based on the tertiary structure validation, molecular docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations results like RMSD, Gyration and RMSF as well as MM/PBSA analysis showed that this protein has a stable construct and is capable being in interaction with bovine TLR4 and TLR9. Analysis of the data obtained suggests that the proposed vaccine can induce the immune response by stimulating T- and B-cells, and may be used for prevention and remedial purposes, against B. melitensis and B. abortus.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Title: Seroprevalence, associated risk factors, and molecular detection of bovine brucellosis in rural areas of Egypt.
Authors: Elhaig Mahmoud M, Wahdan Ali
DOI: 10.1016/j.cimid.2023.101971
Abstract: The study was carried out on six villages in northern Egypt to evaluate the epidemiological situation of bovine brucellosis among 989 unvaccinated household cattle by Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and indirect ELISA (iELISA) and to investigate the existence of Brucella DNA using real-time PCR in 100 milk and 100 sera from seropositive cattle and 50 sera from seronegative cattle. The overall seroprevalence was 20.7% and 23.7% by RBPT and iELISA, respectively. Based on the iELISA results, the seroprevalence was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the village II (34.7%) and cattle > 7 years (30.1%). More males than females were non-significant seropositive (P = 0.6). There was 95% agreement between RBPT and iELISA, although iELISA showed a higher positivity rate (23.7%, 95% CI: 0.21-0.26) than RBPT (20.7%, 95% CI: 0.18-0.24). DNA of Brucella was confirmed in 16 milk samples by IS711 qPCR from seropositive cattle, however, no Brucella DNA was detected in serum samples tested positive and negative. Brucella abortus was the only species detected based on the alkB gene. Prevalence is highly related to the sampling site and the age of the animals. In conclusion, although qPCR is more accurate and commonly used in the diagnosis of most infectious diseases but in this situation iELISA is preferred and recommended for continuous screening and animal movement restriction and vaccination protocols, especially in high-risk areas.

Abstract: Ovine brucellosis is a global zoonotic disease of sheep caused by Brucella melitensis, which inflicts a significant burden on human and animal health. Brucella suis strain S2 (B. suis S2) is a smooth live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of ovine brucellosis in China. However, no previous studies have assessed the immunogenicity of B. suis S2 vaccine after oral immunization in sheep. Here, we attempted to evaluate the ovine immune response over the course of B. suis S2 immunization and to identify in vivo predictors for vaccine development. Body temperature, serum Brucella antibodies, serum cytokines (IL-12p70 and interferon [IFN]-γ), and bacterial load in the mandibular lymph nodes (LN), superficial cervical LN, superficial inguinal LN, and spleen were investigated to determine the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. The abnormal body temperature of sheep occurred within 8 days post-infection (dpi). Brucella suis S2 persisted for a short time (< 21 dpi) in the mandibular LN. The highest level of IL-12p70 was observed at 9 dpi, whereas serum IFN-γ levels peaked at 12 dpi. Transcriptome analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR were performed to determine gene expression profiles in the mandibular LN of sheep. Antigen processing and presentation pathway was the dominant pathway related to the dataset. Our studies suggest that the immune response in ovine LN resembled type 1 immunity with the secretion of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ after B.suis S2 immunization and the vaccine may eliminate Brucella via stimulation of M1 macrophages through the course of Th cells.

DOI: 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1121074
Abstract: Brucellosis, mainly caused by Brucella, is a widespread zoonotic disease worldwide, with no available effective vaccine for human use. Recently, bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella have been prepared in Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 (YeO9), whose O-antigen structure is similar to that of Brucella abortus. However, the pathogenicity of YeO9 still hinders the large-scale production of these bioconjugate vaccines. Here, an attractive system for the preparation of bioconjugate vaccines against Brucella was established in engineered E. coli. Briefly, the OPS gene cluster of YeO9 was modularized into five individual fragments and reassembled using synthetic biological methods through standardized interfaces, then introduced into E. coli. After confirming the synthesis of targeted antigenic polysaccharides, the exogenous protein glycosylation system (PglL system) was used to prepare the bioconjugate vaccines. A series of experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the bioconjugate vaccine could effectively evoke humoral immune responses and induce the production of specific antibodies against B. abortus A19 lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, the bioconjugate vaccines provide protective roles in both lethal and non-lethal challenge of B. abortus A19 strain. Using the engineered E. coli as a safer chassis to prepare bioconjugate vaccines against B. abortus paves the way for future industrial applications.

Title: Toward Public Health Resilience in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: Findings From the Seventh Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network Regional Conference.
Authors: 
DOI: 10.2196/36356
Abstract: The resilience of public health in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) varies from country to country, mostly based on the governmental and financial situation of the countries. With the theme of Towards Public Health Resilience in the EMR: Breaking Barriers, the seventh Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network regional conference, held from November 14 to 18, 2021, was dedicated to exploring ways for achieving public health resilience. A total of 101 oral presentations and 13 poster presentations were presented on various public health topics. The conference included 6 keynote sessions, 10 roundtable sessions, and 5 preconference workshops. The preconference workshops were conducted on border health; the mobilization of Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) residents and graduates and rapid responders in EMR countries; continuous professional development for the public health workforce; brucellosis surveillance using the "One Health" approach; and strategies to integrate and use noncommunicable diseases data sources. The roundtable sessions included discussions on the following topics: the role of FETPs in responding to COVID-19, institutionalization of rapid response to public health emergencies, health systems resilience, integration of early warning and response with event-based and indicator-based surveillance, sustaining international health regulations, strengthening the "One Health" approach, the anticipated future of public health in the post COVID-19 era, supporting public health research capacity in a diverse region, and COVID-19 vaccines and routine immunization synergies and drawbacks. The keynote speaker sessions covered topics on essential public health functions and the universal health coverage challenge in the EMR, lessons from the US COVID-19 public health response, learning from COVID-19, reshaping public health after the pandemic era, COVID-19 resilient primary health care, and the cohesion of society during and after a pandemic. The conference sessions provided highly promising opportunities to explore ways to achieve such goals in the EMR and shed light on the latest scientific findings, important lessons learned, and discussions on the ways in which current barriers can be broken down through coordination and collaboration.

DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2022.0756
Abstract: Brucellosis imposes substantial impacts on livestock production and public health worldwide. A stochastic, age-structured model incorporating herd demographics was developed describing within- and between-herd transmission of Brucella abortus in dairy cattle herds. The model was fitted to data from a cross-sectional study conducted in Punjab State of India and used to evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies under consideration. Based on model results, stakeholder acceptance and constraints regarding vaccine supply, vaccination of replacement calves in large farms should be prioritized. Test and removal applied at early stages of the control programme where seroprevalence is high would not constitute an effective or acceptable use of resources because significant numbers of animals would be 'removed' (culled or not used for breeding) based on false positive results. To achieve sustained reductions in brucellosis, policymakers must commit to maintaining vaccination in the long term, which may eventually reduce frequency of infection in the livestock reservoir to a low enough level for elimination to be a realistic objective. This work provides key strategic insights into the control of brucellosis in India, which has the largest cattle population globally, and a general modelling framework for evaluating control strategies in endemic settings.

Title: Effects of concurrent administration of modified live viral vaccines with RB51 on immune responses to RB51.
Authors: Crawford Lauren, Falkenberg Shollie, Putz Ellie Jordan, Olsen Steven, Boggiatto Paola M
DOI: 10.3389/fvets.2023.1105485
Abstract: Brucella abortus is a gram negative, zoonotic pathogen that can cause abortions and stillbirths in the cattle industry and has contributed to significant economic losses to cow-calf producers. Cell mediated immunity (CMI) is an important component of the immune response associated with protection against Brucella abortus and other intracellular pathogens. Brucellosis and viral modified live vaccines (vMLV) are licensed individually but may be used concurrently under field conditions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-vaccinated cattle and cattle vaccinated with either Brucella abortus strain RB51, a vMLV or both RB51 and a vMLV vaccine were isolated. The frequency of CD4+, CD8+ and γδ+ T cell populations within PBMC, and the frequency of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production within these cell types was characterized via flow-cytometry. The goal of this study was to characterize immune responses to RB51 vaccination and determine the effect of concurrent vaccine administration. Although immune responses were greatest in PBMC from cattle vaccinated with only RB51, cattle vaccinated with both RB51 and vMLV demonstrated measurable T cell responses associated with protective immunity. Data suggests a lack of significant biological differences between the groups in protective immune responses. Collectively, our data demonstrated a lack of vaccine interference following concurrent administration of vMLV and RB51. Although concurrent administration of individually licensed vaccines may influence immune responses and contribute to vaccine interference, potential vaccine combinations should be evaluated for biological effects.

DOI: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2023.105878
Abstract: Brucellosis in livestock is a disease of paramount importance to animal and human health authorities due to its socio-economic and public health consequences. Benefit cost analyses can help policymakers decide whether allocation of resources is economically beneficial to cover the costs of brucellosis control interventions in populations. One broad question of interest is: what are the consequences of acting, or failing to act, on policy options of selected intervention scenarios (e.g., vaccination, test-and-slaughter, vaccination combined with test-and-slaughter, versus a status-quo scenario). The objective of the systematic review reported here was to conduct a critical appraisal of published research reports of economic assessments of brucellosis control interventions in livestock populations. The systematic review followed standard guidelines using a Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context framework and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The review targeted research reports focused on brucellosis control interventions in livestock populations at the national or regional level. Economic outcomes of interest were benefit-cost ratio (BCR), net present value, internal rate of return, or payback period. Eleven studies conducted in Brazil, China, India, Iraq, Mexico, Mongolia, Spain, Turkey, or the USA met the inclusion criteria and were included. The baseline prevalence of brucellosis in selected study populations ranged from 1.4% in cattle in Turkey to 20% in goats in Mexico. In six studies, selected intervention scenarios of vaccination alone produced BCRs that ranged from 3.2 in yaks in China or in cattle, sheep and goats in Mongolia, to 21.3 in cattle and/or buffalo in India. In three studies, interventions of test-and-slaughter produced BCRs that ranged from - 1.2 in goats in Mexico to 0.6 in cattle in Spain. In four studies, vaccination in combination with test-and-slaughter produced BCRs that ranged from 0.2 in yaks in China to 3.7 in cattle and buffalo in India. In seven studies, using sensitivity analysis, different input parameters (prevalence of brucellosis, meat price, cashmere price, vaccination coverage, test-and-slaughter coverage, milk price, vaccination protection, abortion cost, abortion rate, or price of lamb) had an impact on economic outcomes. Vaccination alone was cost-effective, but test-and-slaughter was not, for brucellosis control in selected livestock populations in focus countries. Vaccination in combination with test-and-slaughter produced profitable or nonprofitable economic outcomes. While most studies reported the cost and benefits of implementing brucellosis control interventions, only one study explained socio-economic consequences of economic outcomes, when acting, or failing to act, on selected interventions in livestock populations.

Abstract: Brucellosis is known as one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide affecting both livestock and humans. It causes abortions, reduces milk production, and infertility in infected animals. The disease is routinely diagnosed through three serological techniques, such as rose bengal plate test (RBPT), standard agglutination test (SAT), and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA). The aim of this study was to identify and compare the brucellosis seroprevalence among dairy cattle farms through these different serological tests. From 2112 sampled dairy cattle in different parts of Iran, RBPT, SAT, and I-ELISA led to 296 (14.02%), 215 (10.18%), and 297 (14.06%) positive results, respectively. Brucella abortus biovar 3 (62 cases) was identified as the most common cause of brucellosis in tested animals. Our results showed that the specificity and sensitivity of I-ELISA were higher than those obtained by RBPT and SAT. In this study, the overall agreement of RBPT and SAT with I-ELISA reached 95.21% and 94.12% in dairy cattle farms, respectively. Furthermore, Cohen's kappa statistical analysis revealed that the best degree of agreement was seen between RBPT and I-ELISA (0.80), followed by RBPT and SAT (0.78) and finally SAT and I-ELISA (0.72), thereby indicating a strong agreement between RBPT and I-ELISA methods and good agreement between SAT and I-ELISA methods. The McNemar analysis also showed that a significant difference exists between positive and negative results determined by SAT and I-ELISA methods (p < 0.0001). However, the positive and negative results determined by I-ELISA and RBPT did not show a significant difference (p = 0.9207). Therefore, I-ELISA was a more specific and sensitive serological test when compared to RBPT and SAT and could remarkably decrease non-specific reaction by improving the serological screening specificity for an accurate brucellosis diagnosis in endemic areas.

Abstract: The ongoing antibiotic-resistance crisis is becoming a global problem affecting public health. Urgent efforts are required to design novel therapeutics against pathogenic bacterial species. Brucella melitensis is an etiological agent of brucellosis, which mostly affects sheep and goats but several cases have also been reported in cattle, water buffalo, yaks and dogs. Infected animals also represent the major source of infection for humans. Development of safer and effective vaccines for brucellosis remains a priority to support disease control and eradication in animals and to prevent infection to humans. In this research study, we designed an in-silico multi-epitopes vaccine for B. melitensis using computational approaches. The pathogen core proteome was screened for good vaccine candidates using subtractive proteomics, reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic tools. In total, 10 proteins: catalase; siderophore ABC transporter substrate-binding protein; pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase; superoxide dismutase; peptidylprolyl isomerase; superoxide dismutase family protein; septation protein A; hypothetical protein; binding-protein-dependent transport systems inner membrane component; and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoheptanedioate aldolase were selected for epitopes prediction. To induce cellular and antibody base immune responses, the vaccine must comprise both B and T-cells epitopes. The epitopes were next screened for antigenicity, allergic nature and water solubility and the probable antigenic, non-allergic, water-soluble and non-toxic nine epitopes were shortlisted for multi-epitopes vaccine construction. The designed vaccine construct comprises 274 amino acid long sequences having a molecular weight of 28.14 kDa and instability index of 27.62. The vaccine construct was further assessed for binding efficacy with immune cell receptors. Docking results revealed that the designed vaccine had good binding potency with selected immune cell receptors. Furthermore, vaccine-MHC-I, vaccine-MHC-II and vaccine-TLR-4 complexes were opted based on a least-binding energy score of -5.48 kcal/mol, 0.64 kcal/mol and -2.69 kcal/mol. Those selected were then energy refined and subjected to simulation studies to understand dynamic movements of the docked complexes. The docking results were further validated through MMPBSA and MMGBSA analyses. The MMPBSA calculated -235.18 kcal/mol, -206.79 kcal/mol, and -215.73 kcal/mol net binding free energy, while MMGBSA estimated -259.48 kcal/mol, -206.79 kcal/mol and -215.73 kcal/mol for TLR-4, MHC-I and MHC-II complexes, respectively. These findings were validated by water-swap and entropy calculations. Overall, the designed vaccine construct can evoke proper immune responses and the construct could be helpful for experimental researchers in formulation of a protective vaccine against the targeted pathogen for both animal and human use.

Title: Effector Proteins of Type IV Secretion System: Weapons of Brucella Used to Fight Against Host Immunity
Authors: Zheng Min, Lin Ruiqi, Zhu Jinying, Dong Qiao, Chen Jingjing, Jiang Pengfei, Zhang Huan, Liu Jinling, Chen Zeliang
DOI: 10.2174/1574888X18666230222124529
Abstract: Brucella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen capable of long-term persistence in the host, resulting in chronic infections in livestock and wildlife. The type IV secretion system (T4SS) is an important virulence factor of Brucella and is composed of 12 protein complexes encoded by the VirB operon. T4SS exerts its function through its secreted 15 effector proteins. The effector proteins act on important signaling pathways in host cells, inducing host immune responses and promoting the survival and replication of Brucella in host cells to promote persistent infection. In this article, we describe the intracellular circulation of Brucella-infected cells and survey the role of Brucella VirB T4SS in regulating inflammatory responses and suppressing host immune responses during infection. In addition, the important mechanisms of these 15 effector proteins in resisting the host immune response during Brucella infection are elucidated. For example, VceC and VceA assist in achieving sustained survival of Brucella in host cells by affecting autophagy and apoptosis. BtpB, together with BtpA, controls the activation of dendritic cells during infection, induces inflammatory responses, and controls host immunity. This article reviews the effector proteins secreted by Brucella T4SS and their involvement in immune responses, which can provide a reliable theoretical basis for the subsequent mechanism of hijacking the host cell signaling pathway by bacteria and contribute to the development of better vaccines to effectively treat Brucella bacterial infection.

Title: Regional variation in knowledge and practice regarding common zoonoses among livestock farmers of selective districts in Nepal.
Authors: Bagale Kosh Bilash, Adhikari Ramesh, Acharya Devaraj
DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0011082
Abstract: Background: The majority of Nepalese people are involved in farming. However, due to limited knowledge of zoonoses and poor preventive practices on the part of livestock farmers, vulnerabilities to zoonotic diseases are very high. The main objective of this study was to assess the regional variation in zoonoses-related knowledge and preventive practices of livestock farmers in different ecological regions of Nepal. Material and methods: Descriptive cross-sectional quantitative research design was followed in the study. The total sample size was 380 livestock farmers from randomly selected three ecological regions of Nepal. Systematic sampling techniques were applied for data collection. Data were entered into an excel sheet and then imported into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The data were calculated using descriptive statistics. Univariate, and bivariate analyses were performed, and the result of the study was presented in the form of text and tables based on their nature. Results: Of the studied six zoonotic diseases, most of the respondents (95.8%) knew about zoonotic bird flu; 90.7% of them, were about rabies; and 54.2% knew about swine flu. However, a few respondents knew about bovine tuberculosis, neurocysticercosis, and brucellosis. Ecologically, the highest number of respondents in Nawalpur had knowledge of rabies (95.3%), and swine flu (61.6%), whereas 98.3% of them had knowledge of avian influenza in Tanahun; and 12.5% of neurocysticercosis in Manang. Regarding zoonoses preventive practices such as regular hand washing with soap water, mask-wearing, gloves, boots, the respondents' representation of 60.8%, 6.6%, 1.8%, and 1.3% respectively in such practices show that although these are easy and cost-effective, personal protective equipment (PPE), such preventive practices were extremely underperformed. Not only that, only 12% of respondents maintain a standard distance (>15m.) between their house and shed. Similarly, 17% still consumed meat from sick animals, and vaccination of livestock was also found poor coverage (36%) in the study. Conclusions: Livestock farmers need to be more knowledgeable about many common zoonotic diseases, and their preventive practices still need improvement, with significant regional variation in the study. This has invited various zoonosis threats for them. Therefore, it is recommended that the interventional programs related to common zoonoses be conducted for livestock farmers to solve the problem.

DOI: 10.1017/S095026882300016X
Abstract: National disease surveillance systems are essential to a healthy pig industry but can be costly and logistically complex. In 2019, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) piloted an abattoir disease surveillance system to assess for the presence of high impact pig diseases (HIPDs) using serological methods. The Lao Department of Livestock and Fisheries (DLF) identified Classical Swine Fever (CSF), Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS) and Brucella suis as HIPDs of interest for sero-surveillance purposes. Porcine serum samples (n = 597) were collected from six Lao abattoirs in March to December of 2019. Serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods were chosen for their high-throughput and relatively low-costs. The true seroprevalence for CSF and PRRS seropositivity were 68.7%, 95% CI (64.8-72.3) and 39.5%, 95% CI (35.7-43.5), respectively. The results demonstrated no evidence of Brucella spp. seroconversion. Lao breed pigs were less likely to be CSF seropositive (P < 0.05), whilst pigs slaughtered at <1 year of age were less likely to be PRRS seropositive (P < 0.01). The testing methods could not differentiate between seropositivity gained from vaccine or natural infection, and investigators were unable to obtain the vaccine status of the slaughtered pigs from the abattoirs. These results demonstrate that adequate sample sizes are possible from abattoir sero-surveillance and lifetime health traceability is necessary to understand HIPDs in Lao PDR.

DOI: 10.3390/pathogens12010082
Abstract: Brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease in Iran. Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Brucella isolates have been reported from different developing countries, posing an imminent health hazard. The objective of this study was to evaluate AMR and virulence-associated factors in Brucella isolates recovered from humans and animals in different regions of Iran using classical phenotyping and next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Our findings revealed that B. melitensis is the most common species in bovines, small ruminants and camels. B. abortus was isolated only from one human case. Probable intermediate or resistant phenotype patterns for rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin-sulbactam and colistin were found. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified mprF, bepG, bepF, bepC, bepE, and bepD in all isolates but failed to determine other classical AMR genes. Forty-three genes associated with five virulence factors were identified in the genomes of all Brucella isolates, and no difference in the distribution of virulence-associated genes was found. Of them, 27 genes were associated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 12 genes were related to a type IV secretion system (virB1-B12), two were associated with the toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins (btpA, btpB), one gene encoded the Rab2 interacting conserved protein A (ricA) and one was associated with the production of cyclic β-1,2 glucans (cgs). This is the first investigation reporting the molecular-based AMR and virulence factors in brucellae isolated from different animal hosts and humans in Iran. Iranian B. abortus and B. melitensis isolates are still in vitro susceptible to the majority of antibiotics used for the treatment of human brucellosis. WGS failed to determine classical AMR genes and no difference was found in the distribution of virulence-associated genes in all isolates. Still, the absence of classical AMR genes in genomes of resistant strains is puzzling, and investigation of phenotypic resistance mechanisms at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels is needed.

Title: Vaccine properties of Brucella melitensis 16MΔwzm and reactivation of placental infection in pregnant sheep.
Authors: Zabalza-Baranguá A, Poveda-Urkixo I, Mena-Bueno S, Ramírez G A, De Bolle X, Grilló M J

Abstract: Brucellosis, a worldwide zoonotic disease, is endemic in many developing countries. Besides causing significant economic losses for the livestock industry, it has severe consequences for human health. In endemic regions, small ruminants infected by Brucella melitensis are the main source of human brucellosis. Rev1, the only vaccine currently recommended to control the disease in sheep and goats, has several drawbacks. Rough lipopolysaccharide (R-LPS) mutants have been tested as alternatives, but most lack efficacy. Those in the Wzm/Wzt system responsible for O-polysaccharide export to the periplasm have been proposed as promising vaccine candidates, although to date they have been scarcely investigated in the natural host. In the present work, we studied the biological properties of a 16MΔwzm in-frame deletion mutant, including its safety in pregnant mice and sheep. In mice, 16MΔwzm prevented placental and fetal infections before parturition and protected against B. melitensis and Brucella ovis infections. In sheep, 16MΔwzm was equally safe in lambs, rams, and non-pregnant ewes, inducing some transient Rose Bengal reactions (<7 weeks). The serological reactions occurred earlier and more strongly in pregnant than in non-pregnant ewes and were significantly reduced when conjunctival rather than subcutaneous vaccination was used. In ewes vaccinated at mid-pregnancy, 16MΔwzm was not shed in vaginal discharges during the pregnancy and did not induce abortions/stillbirths. However, some ewes showed a transitory reactivation of infection in placentas and/or milk at parturition, accompanied by a seroconversion in smooth LPS (S-LPS) and/or R-LPS tests. Overall, 16MΔwzm can be considered as a safe vaccine for lambs, rams, and non-pregnant ewes, but its use at mid-pregnancy should be avoided to prevent vaccine dissemination at parturition. If the efficacy results against B. melitensis and B. ovis observed in mice are confirmed by further studies in the natural host, 16MΔwzm could constitute a useful vaccine.

Title: Evaluation of the goat cellular immune response to rBtuB-Hia-FlgK peptides from Brucella melitensis.
Authors: De la Rosa-Ramos Miguel A, Arellano-Reynoso B, Hernández-Badillo E, Guerra-Infante Fernando M, Mancilla-Herrera I, Chaki S P, Ficht T A, Suárez-Güemes F

Abstract: Brucellosis is a zoonosis caused by Brucella; B. melitensis is the most prevalent species in goats and humans. Previously, three B. melitensis peptides, rBtuB-Hia-FlgK showed antigen-specific immune responses in rodent models. The goal of this study was to evaluate the goat Th1/Th2 immune response to B. melitensis peptides. Twenty-eight animals were separated into four groups and were immunized with the rBtuB-Hia-FlgK peptides cocktail, adjuvant, PBS and Rev-1 vaccine, respectively. Peripheral blood samples were collected on days 0, 15, and 80 post-inoculation. The CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferation, and cytokine production of the Th-1 (IL-2, IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) and Th-2 profiles (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) were evaluated. An increase of CD4+/CD8+ at 15 days post-vaccination was observed and continued until the 80th. In addition, the IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 mRNA expression were typically induced by the 15th day, but only IFN-γ levels were observed at day 80 post-immunization. Brucella pathogenesis is distinguished by the presence of a large amount of Th-1 cytokines. Although a reduced amount of IFN-γ in the culture supernatant was accurately detected compared with Rev-1 after 15 days, it could be influenced by the sampling schedule, as a higher cytokine production might be induced as early as the first-week post-vaccination. The results indicate that rBtuB-Hia-FlgK induced an immune response similar to the Rev-1 vaccine. The possible use of inert molecules with the unique ability to typically induce cellular response similar to attenuated vaccine represents an attractive option that should not be ruled out.

Abstract: Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses in the Middle East. It is causing economic losses to the livestock industry and has a great public health concern. Little is known about the genetic diversity and distribution of brucellae in Iran. Therefore, forty Brucella spp. strains (B. abortus and B. melitensis) isolated from animals and humans were analyzed by whole genome sequencing (WGS) technology using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Brucella isolates were obtained from lymph nodes (cows and camels), milk (cows, camels and sheep), and aborted foetus samples (sheep and goats), as well as cerebrospinal fluid and blood of humans. The isolates were originating from thirteen provinces of Iran and isolated between 2015 and 2020. According to in-silico MLST, ST8 and ST2 were the most frequent sequence types in B. melitensis and B. abortus, respectively. Based on phylogeographic reconstruction using cgSNP analysis, the investigated Iranian B. melitensis strains belonged to the American and Mediterranean lineages of the B. melitensis phylogeny. Furthermore, cgSNP analysis revealed a similarity between Iranian B. abortus isolates and strains from Iraq and Egypt. Therefore, the origin of the Iranian strains can be suggested to be strains from neighboring and Middle East countries. Moreover, cgMLST analysis showed that the Iranian B. melitensis strains were closely relative to strains recovered from sheep and humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Turkmenistan, and Pakistan. In the current panel of strains, cgMLST and cgSNP analysis provided an appropriate and accurate tool for effective traceback analyses for Brucella spp. from Iran. The results of cgSNP and cgMLST helped to understand the geographic distribution and interspecies transmission of Iranian strains and highlight the importance of specific brucellosis control measures in Iran with regard to the One-Health approach.

Title: Multi-Epitope Vaccine Candidates Associated with Mannosylated Chitosan and LPS Conjugated Chitosan Nanoparticles Against Brucella Infection.
Authors: Sadeghi Zohre, Fasihi-Ramandi Mahdi, Davoudi Zahra, Bouzari Saeid
DOI: 10.1016/j.xphs.2022.12.025
Abstract: One promising approach to increase protection against infectious diseases is to use adjuvants that can selectively stimulate the immune responses. In this study, multi-epitope antigens associated with LPS loaded chitosan (LLC) as toll-like receptor agonist or mannosylated chitosan nanoparticle (MCN) as vaccine delivery system were evaluated for their ability to stimulate immune responses to Brucella infection in mice model. Our results indicated that the addition of MCN to our vaccine formulations significantly elicited IFN-γ and IL-2 cytokines and antibody titers, in comparison with the non-adjuvanted vaccine candidates. The present results indicated that multi-epitopes and their administration with LLC or MCN induced Th1 immune response. In addition, vaccine candidates containing MCN provided high percentage of protection against B. melitensis and B. abortus infection. Our results provided support to previous reports indicating that MCNs are attractive adjuvants and addition of this adjuvant to multi-epitopes antigens play an important role in the development of vaccine against Brucella.

Authors: Pei Meijuan, Dong Ao, Ma Xueping, Li Shulei, Guo Yan, Li Menglan, Wang Zhenghui, Wang Hengliang, Zhu Li, Pan Chao, Wang Yufei

Abstract: Background: Brucellosis, caused by Brucella spp., is a major zoonotic public health threat. Although several Brucella vaccines have been demonstrated for use in animals, Brucella spp. can cause human infection and to date, there are no human-use vaccines licensed by any agency. Recently, methods in vaccine informatics have made major breakthroughs in peptide-based epitopes, opening up a new avenue of vaccine development. Objectives: The purpose of this article was to identify potential antigenic peptides in Brucella by proteome and peptidome analyses. Methods: Mouse infection models were first established by injection with Brucella and spleen protein profiles were then analysed. Subsequently, the major histocompatibility complex class I or II (major histocompatibility complex [MHC]-I/II)-binding peptides in blood samples were collected by immunoprecipitation and peptides derived from Brucella proteins were identified through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). These peptides were then evaluated in a variety of ways, such as in terms of conservation in Brucella and synchronicity in predicted peptides (similarity and coverage), which allowed us to more effectively measure their antigenic potential. Results: The expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IFN-γ was significantly altered in the spleen of infected mice and some Brucella proteins, such as Muri, AcpP and GroES, were also detected. Meanwhile, in blood, 35 peptides were identified and most showed high conservation, highlighting their potential as antigen epitopes for vaccine development. In particular, we identified four proteins containing both MHC-I- and MHC-II-binding peptides including AtpA, AtpD, DnaK and BAbS19_II02030. They were also compared with the predicted peptides to estimate their reliability. Conclusions: The peptides we screened could bind to MHC molecules. After being stimulated with antigen T epitopes, Memory T cells can stimulate T cell activation and promote immune responses. Our results indicated that the peptides we identified may be good candidate targets for the design of subunit vaccines and these results pave the way for the study of safer vaccines against Brucella.

Title: Immunoinformatic-guided designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct against Brucella Suis 1300.
Authors: Jalal Khurshid, Khan Kanwal, Uddin Reaz
DOI: 10.1007/s12026-022-09346-0
Abstract: Brucella suis mediates the transmission of brucellosis in humans and animals and a significant facultative zoonotic pathogen found in livestock. It has the capacity to survive and multiply in a phagocytic environment and to acquire resistance under hostile conditions thus becoming a threat globally. Antibiotic resistance is posing a substantial public health threat, hence there is an unmet and urgent clinical need for immune-based non-antibiotic methods to treat brucellosis. Hence, we aimed to explore the whole proteome of Brucella suis to predict antigenic proteins as a vaccine target and designed a novel chimeric vaccine (multi-epitope vaccine) through subtractive genomics-based reverse vaccinology approaches. The applied subsequent hierarchical shortlisting resulted in the identification of Multidrug efflux Resistance-nodulation-division (RND) transporter outer membrane subunit (gene BepC) that may act as a potential vaccine target. T-cell and B-cell epitopes have been predicted from target proteins using a number of immunoinformatic methods. Six MHC I, ten MHC II, and four B-cell epitopes were used to create a 324-amino-acid MEV construct, which was coupled with appropriate linkers and adjuvant. To boost the immunological response to the vaccine, the vaccine was combined with the TLR4 agonist HBHA protein. The MEV structure predicted was found to be highly antigenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic, flexible, stable, and soluble. To confirm the interactions with the receptors, a molecular docking simulation of the MEV was done using the human TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) and HLAs. The stability and binding of the MEV-docked complexes with TLR4 were assessed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Finally, MEV was reverse translated, its cDNA structure was evaluated, and then, in silico cloning into an E. coli expression host was conducted to promote maximum vaccine protein production with appropriate post-translational modifications. These comprehensive computer calculations backed up the efficacy of the suggested MEV in protecting against B. suis infections. However, more experimental validations are needed to adequately assess the vaccine candidate's potential. HIGHLIGHTS: • Subtractive genomic analysis and reverse vaccinology for the prioritization of novel vaccine target • Examination of chimeric vaccine in terms of allergenicity, antigenicity, MHC I, II binding efficacy, and structural-based studies • Molecular docking simulation method to rank based vaccine candidate and understand their binding modes.

Title: Study on small ruminant brucellosis and owners awareness in two selected districts of southern region, Ethiopia.
Authors: Dosa Desalegn, Mohammed Nejib, Mathewos Mesfin
DOI: 10.1002/vms3.992
Abstract: Introduction: Brucellosis is one of the infectious diseases that has the greatest impact on the productivity of sheep and goats. A cross-sectional study followed by a simple random sampling technique was used to investigate the seroprevalence of brucellosis (Rose Bengal plate test; RBPT and complement fixation test; CFT) in small ruminants and its related risk variables from November 2019 to June 2020 in Kolme and Abala Abaya districts. A questionnaire was also given to owners to assess their existing knowledge of the disease. Result: Using the RBPT and CFT, 28 (4.1%) and 23 (3.33%) of the 690 animals were found to be seropositive for brucellosis, respectively. In this study, the seroprevalence of brucellosis detected in the Kolme district (5.3%) was greater when compared to Abala Abaya (1.0%). The odds of Brucella infection were greater for goats (odds ratio [OR] 6.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 16 0.8-44.9) than for sheep. The odds of adult animals (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.03-0.07) being positive for brucellosis was higher than young animals. A statistically significant difference in the seropositivity of brucellosis was detected in univariate logistic regression among districts, different age groups, herd size, parity number, and reproductive health problems except for species and sex, but in multivariate logistic regression, only reproductive health problems were revealed a statistically significant difference. Out of 138 families, 100% of respondents were unaware of brucellosis, 94.5% drink raw milk, and 74% handle animals with retained fetal membranes with their bare hands. Conclusion: This study showed that brucellosis was a widely spread disease in the study areas and poses a substantial public health danger. To reduce the spread of the disease in small ruminants, public health risks, and economic losses, stringent vaccination application and awareness of personal hygiene are critical.
